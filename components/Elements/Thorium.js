            <h1>Thorium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Thorium was discovered in 1828 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who received a sample of an unknown mineral from the Reverend Has Morten Thrane Esmark, who suspected it contained an unknown substance. Berzelius was able to isolate a new element from the mineral, which he named Thorium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Thorium is named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Thorium is found naturally in small amounts in most rocks and soils, where it is about three times more abundant than uranium. It is a naturally radioactive element and primarily exists in the form of Thorium-232.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Thorium is a silvery, somewhat malleable metal that is resistant to corrosion, except for hydrochloric acid. It is a poor conductor of heat and electricity and has a high melting point. When heated in air, thorium becomes coated with thorium oxide. The metal is dimorphic, changing from one form to another at around 1400°C. </p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Despite its radioactivity, thorium has a number of uses. It has been used in the mantles of portable gas lights, which glow with an intense light when heated. It also has applications in the aerospace industry, where it is used in the production of aircraft engines. Thorium has potential use in nuclear energy.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Thorium is chemically reactive and forms various compounds. When exposed to air, thorium slowly tarnishes, becoming gray and eventually black. When heated in air, thorium metal ignites and burns with a brilliant white light. Thorium reacts with halogens, most acids, and hot alkalis.</p>
