            <h1>Scandium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Scandium was discovered in 1879 by Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson, who found it in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite, which had not yet been found anywhere else on earth.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Scandium' comes from the Latin word 'Scandia', which means Scandinavia, the region where it was discovered.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Scandium is a rare element, found in trace amounts in many minerals. It's usually found only in two types of ores, thortveitite (a type of mineral) and uranium ores. The sun and certain stars are thought to contain relatively more scandium than the Earth.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Scandium, the twenty-first element on the periodic table, is a soft, light, silver-white metal. It is a transition metal and exhibits a high reactivity in air, quickly forming a pink or yellow coating of scandium oxide.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Scandium doesn't have a ton of applications due to its scarcity and high cost. However, one of its significant uses is in aluminum-scandium alloys for aerospace components. It's also used in high-intensity lamps, such as those found in film projectors and night-time photography.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Scandium reacts with many acids and with many nonmetals at high temperatures. For instance, it reacts with oxygen to form scandium oxide. Despite its reactivity, due to its rarity and high cost, it isn't typically seen interacting with many common elements in daily life.</p>
