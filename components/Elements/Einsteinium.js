            <h1>Einsteinium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Einsteinium was first identified in 1952 by a team of scientists led by Albert Ghiorso. The team found it in the debris from the first hydrogen bomb explosion, codenamed "Ivy Mike," which took place in November 1951.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Einsteinium was named in honor of the physicist Albert Einstein, one of the most renowned scientists of the 20th century known for developing the theory of relativity.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Einsteinium does not occur naturally on Earth. It's primarily synthesized in minute quantities in laboratories or during nuclear tests.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive metal. It's highly reactive and tarnishes in the air quite rapidly. It belongs to the actinide series and is located in period 7 of the periodic table. Einsteinium-253, one of its isotopes, is notable for its half-life of 20.47 days.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Due to its scarcity, high radioactivity and short half-life, einsteinium has no significant industrial use. It is primarily used for scientific research purposes, often acting as a starting material for the production of other transuranic elements and transactinides.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Einsteinium reacts with oxygen to form Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3). It can also form halides with halogens, such as Einsteinium(III) chloride (EsCl3) and Einsteinium(III) bromide (EsBr3). Due to its radioactivity and scarcity, however, reactions with many other elements have not been extensively studied.</p>
