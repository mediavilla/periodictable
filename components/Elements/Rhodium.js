            <h1>Rhodium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Rhodium was discovered in 1803 by English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, who extracted it from a sample of platinum ore he obtained from South America. He isolated it soon after his discovery of the element palladium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Rhodium' comes from the Greek word 'rhodon', which means 'rose'. This name was chosen because of the rose-red color of its salts.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Rhodium is found in the Earth's crust in minute amounts, typically as a byproduct of mining for platinum and nickel. South Africa is the world's leading producer of this rare metal.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Rhodium, the forty-fifth element on the periodic table, is a hard, silvery-white transition metal. It's highly reflective, resistant to corrosion, and extremely rare.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Rhodium is often used as a catalyst in industrial processes, especially in catalytic converters for cars to reduce harmful emissions. It's also used in jewelry, typically as a plating for white gold and silver to enhance their shine and durability.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Rhodium can form various compounds with other elements, especially when used as a catalyst. These include compounds with hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, which are essential in many industrial chemical reactions.</p>
