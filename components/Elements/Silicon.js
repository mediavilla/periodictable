            <h1>Silicon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Silicon was first identified by the Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius in 1824. He managed to isolate this element by heating chips of potassium in a silica container and then carefully washing away the byproducts.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Silicon' comes from the Latin word 'silex' or 'silicis', which means flint.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up about 28% of it by weight. It's not found free in nature, but occurs chiefly as the oxide (silica) and as silicates. The oxide includes sand, quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, agate, flint and opal.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Silicon, the fourteenth element on the periodic table, is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre. It's a semiconductor, meaning that it does conduct electricity under some conditions, which makes it incredibly important in many electronic devices.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Silicon has a wide range of uses. It's a key component in bricks, concrete, glass, ceramics, and silicones. Most importantly, it's used in the production of electronic devices and solar cells because of its semiconductor properties. Silicon chips are used in most electronic devices today, from computers to mobile phones.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Silicon reacts with oxygen in the air to form silicon dioxide. At high temperatures, it also reacts with nitrogen and certain metals to form silicides. Furthermore, silicon forms a variety of compounds with hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements, and is a vital component of many minerals and rocks.</p>
