            <h1>Lithium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Lithium was first discovered by Johan August Arfwedson in 1817, in Stockholm, Sweden, when he was analyzing a mineral from the island of Uto. He was not able to isolate the element in pure form. However, later in 1855, Sir Humphry Davy and William Thomas Brande were able to isolate lithium through the electrolysis of lithium chloride.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Lithium' comes from the Greek word 'lithos' which means 'stone'. This name was chosen because lithium was first discovered from a mineral, while other common alkali metals were discovered from plant material.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Lithium is not found freely in nature due to its high reactivity, but is found in nearly all igneous rocks and in the waters of many mineral springs. It's the 33rd most abundant element on Earth. Also, trace amounts of lithium are found in all organisms.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Lithium is the third element on the periodic table and the lightest metal. It is soft enough to cut with a kitchen knife and has a silver-white color. It's a good conductor of heat and electricity. Also, interestingly, it's the least dense solid element and can float on water - but be careful, because it also reacts with water to form hydrogen gas, which can catch fire!</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Lithium has many uses. Perhaps most famously, it's used in lithium-ion batteries which power a lot of our modern electronics like laptops and electric cars. It's also used in some medicines for treating bipolar disorder. Additionally, it's used in the manufacture of aircraft and certain types of glass and ceramics.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Lithium reacts easily with water and with many other elements because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it wants to give away. It's often combined with aluminum and magnesium for lightweight alloys, and with carbon to form lithium carbide. It also plays a critical role in nuclear fusion reactions, including those that power the Sun and other stars.</p>
