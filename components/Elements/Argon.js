            <h1>Argon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Argon was discovered in 1894 by two British scientists, Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay, when they were investigating the difference between the density of nitrogen found in the air versus nitrogen released from chemicals.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Argon' comes from the Greek word 'argos', meaning 'lazy' or 'inactive'. This refers to the fact that Argon is inert and does not readily engage in chemical reactions.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Argon is the third most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, accounting for about 0.94%. It's obtained commercially by the distillation of liquid air. Argon is also found in some mineral waters, in the gases released by volcanic activity, and in some crystals such as potassium argonite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Argon, the eighteenth element on the periodic table, is a colorless, odorless, tasteless and non-toxic gas. It is inert under most conditions and forms no stable compounds at room temperature.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Argon has many uses. Its primary use is in light bulbs and other types of illumination, such as neon lights, where it provides an environment that will not react with the filament even at high temperatures. Argon is also used as an inert shield for arc welding and cutting, as a blanket for the production of titanium and other reactive elements, and as a protective atmosphere for growing silicon and germanium crystals.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Argon is part of the noble gases group of elements, which are known for being chemically inert due to having full electron configurations. As such, Argon doesn't readily react with other elements. It can form some compounds under specific conditions, but these are not naturally occurring and are not stable at room temperature.</p>
