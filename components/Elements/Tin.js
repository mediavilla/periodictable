            <h1>Tin</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Tin has been known since ancient times. It was first used and mined around 3000 BC. The earliest use of tin was in the Bronze Age, as an alloy with copper to create bronze, which is more durable and harder than its individual components.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Tin' comes from the Anglo-Saxon word 'tin'. The symbol for tin, 'Sn', comes from the Latin word for tin, 'stannum'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Tin is not usually found as a pure metal in nature; instead, it's found in ores like cassiterite. The largest producers of tin today are China, Indonesia, and Peru.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Tin is a silvery-white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It has two forms: white tin, which is metallic and stable at room temperature, and gray tin, which is nonmetallic and occurs at low temperatures. Tin is resistant to corrosion from water but can be attacked by strong acids and alkalis.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Tin's most significant use is in tin plating of steel, which protects the steel from corrosion. It's also used to make alloys, such as bronze (with copper) and pewter (with lead). In addition, tin is used in solders for joining pipes or electric circuits, in glass-making, and in various organic compounds.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Tin can form compounds with many other elements. For example, when combined with copper, it forms the alloy bronze. Tin also forms a series of compounds with the halogens, known as tin halides, and it can form organic compounds called organotin compounds.</p>
