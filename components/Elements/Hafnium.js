            <h1>Hafnium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Hafnium was discovered in 1923 by Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy in Copenhagen, Denmark. They found hafnium in the mineral zircon using X-ray spectroscopy.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Hafnium's name comes from "Hafnia," which is the Latin name for Copenhagen, the city where it was discovered.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Hafnium is found in the Earth's crust, often alongside zirconium in minerals. It isn't found freely in nature but exists in ores like zircon and alvite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Hafnium is a lustrous, silvery metal that is corrosion resistant. It is part of the transition metals group, and interestingly, it's very similar to zirconium in many of its properties.  It's also used in plasma cutting tips for its high melting point, and it's a component of microchips in the electronics industry. It's resistant to corrosion due to the formation of an oxide layer on its surface. It has a high melting point and is good at absorbing neutrons.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Because of its neutron-absorption capabilities, hafnium is primarily used in control rods of nuclear reactors.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elementss</h4>
            <p>Hafnium often plays well with similar transition metals like zirconium and titanium. Its high-temperature stability complements other elements in alloy formation, especially in high-temperature applications such as jet engines or gas turbines.</p>
