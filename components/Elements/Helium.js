            <h1>Helium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery:</h4>
            <p>Helium was first discovered in the Sun's atmosphere during a solar eclipse in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen and English astronomer Norman Lockyer. It was found on Earth for the first time by Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay in 1895.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin:</h4>
            <p>The name 'Helium' comes from the Greek word 'helios', which means 'sun'. It was named this because it was first discovered in the Sun before it was found here on Earth.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, found in large amounts in stars and gas giant planets. On Earth, it is a trace element in the atmosphere but can be found in larger amounts in natural gas fields.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics:</h4>
            <p>Helium is the second element on the periodic table. It is a noble gas, which means it is very stable and doesn't readily react with other elements. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and is the lowest boiling and melting point of all the elements. It is also the lightest element that is not radioactive.</p>

            <h4>Applications:</h4>
            <p>You've probably seen helium in balloons and blimps because it is lighter than air and allows them to float. It's also used to cool the magnets in MRI scanners in hospitals, in the manufacture of computer chips, and by deep-sea divers in their breathing mix to prevent nitrogen narcosis.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements:</h4>
            <p>Helium is a noble gas, which means it's quite a loner and doesn't like to mix with other elements. This is because it has a complete set of electrons in its outer shell, making it very stable and unreactive. But this is what makes helium so useful in things like balloons and cooling systems because it won't react and cause a chemical change.</p>
