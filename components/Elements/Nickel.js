            <h1>Nickel</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Nickel was first identified as a unique element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, a Swedish mineralogist and chemist. He originally thought he had discovered copper but realized it was a new element upon further examination.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Nickel' comes from the German word 'kupfernickel', meaning "Old Nick's copper," a term used by German miners. They named it this because, although they thought the ore contained copper, they were unable to extract any, leading them to think that the devil (nicknamed Old Nick) was playing tricks on them.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Nickel is not usually found as a pure metal in nature; it is more commonly found in the Earth's crust combined with sulfur, iron, and arsenic, among other elements. Major nickel deposits are located in New Caledonia, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, and Russia.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Nickel, the twenty-eighth element on the periodic table, is a hard, lustrous, silvery-white metal that's highly ductile and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d8 4s2. This might seem unusual because elements typically prefer to have either a half-filled or fully filled d sub-level for stability. Some might expect Nickel to have a configuration of [Ar] 3d9 4s1, similar to certain other elements. However, experimental evidence confirms that Nickel's electron configuration is indeed [Ar] 3d8 4s2. The exact reasons for this involve complex principles of quantum mechanics and are not fully understood.</p>


            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Nickel is widely used in many areas. More than two-thirds of the global nickel production is used for stainless steel. It's also used in other types of steel, batteries, coinage, and special alloys. Additionally, nickel is used as a catalyst in the chemical industry.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Nickel can form compounds with most elements and is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. It stands up well to corrosion and is often used in alloys, particularly with iron.</p>
