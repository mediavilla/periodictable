            <h1>Samarium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Samarium was discovered by French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1879. He detected the new element in a sample of the mineral samarskite, hence the name Samarium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Samarium originates from the mineral 'samarskite', which itself was named after a Russian mining engineer, Colonel Samarsky.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Samarium is found in several minerals including monazite and bastnaesite, which are important sources of rare earth elements. It is usually mined from these minerals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Samarium is a rare earth metal which is relatively stable in air. It tarnishes in air and ignites at 150 Â°C. Two natural isotopes of samarium are mildly radioactive.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Samarium has several interesting applications. Samarium-cobalt magnets are extremely powerful and are often used in headphones, professional loudspeakers, and in motors for cordless tools. Samarium is also used in nuclear reactors and in treating certain types of cancers.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Samarium, like other lanthanides, can form compounds with various other elements. Its compounds with cobalt are particularly notable for their strong magnetic properties.</p>
