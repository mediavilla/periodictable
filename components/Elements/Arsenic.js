            <h1>Arsenic</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Arsenic has been known since ancient times, so it's difficult to pinpoint an exact discoverer. Alchemists in the Hellenistic era (approximately 300 BC) knew about arsenic. Albertus Magnus, a German alchemist, is credited with the isolation of arsenic in a purer form in 1250.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Arsenic' originates from the Greek word 'arsenikon,' which means 'masculine' or 'potent.' It was borrowed from a Persian word 'Zarnikh,' meaning 'yellow orpiment.'</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Arsenic rarely occurs as a pure elemental crystal but is more often found as arsenopyrite and in arsenic-containing minerals. It's mainly obtained as a byproduct from the processing of other metals, like copper and lead.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Arsenic, the thirty-third element on the periodic table, is a metalloid. It has various allotropes, but the most common one, gray arsenic, is a brittle, crystalline solid. It tarnishes in air and when heated, it rapidly oxidizes to arsenic trioxide, which has a garlic odor.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Despite its toxicity, arsenic has several uses. It's used in lead alloys, car batteries, and ammunition. It's also used in the production of pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides, though these uses have been declining due to environmental impact. Arsenic compounds can be used in the treatment of certain medical conditions, such as cancer.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Arsenic reacts with other elements to form a variety of compounds. For example, when burned in air, arsenic can form arsenic trioxide. It can also combine with metals to form arsenides.</p>
