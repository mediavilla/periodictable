            <h1>Strontium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Strontium was discovered by Adair Crawford, an Irish physician, in 1790 when he noticed a new mineral in the samples of witherite. However, it was not until 1808 that the element was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy, an English chemist, through the process of electrolysis.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Strontium' comes from Strontian, a village in Scotland where the mineral witherite was discovered in abundance.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Strontium is quite common in the Earth's crust and is found as a mineral in celestite and strontianite. Strontium is also found in sea water and river water.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Strontium, the thirty-eighth element in the periodic table, is a soft, silver-yellow, alkaline-earth metal. It has three allotropic crystalline forms and in its physical and chemical properties it is similar to calcium and barium. Strontium reacts vigorously with water and quickly tarnishes in air, so it must be stored out of contact with air and water.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Strontium has several uses. It is used in producing ferrite magnets and refining zinc. Strontium titanate is an optical material with a very high refractive index and an optical dispersion greater than that of diamond. It is also used in the making of fireworks and flares, which gives them a deep red color.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Strontium is chemically reactive, and it can form a wide range of compounds. For example, when combined with oxygen, it forms strontium oxide. It also forms a number of salts when reacted with acids. It reacts with water to form strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.</p>
