            <h1>Gallium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Gallium was discovered by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875. He noticed its existence in zinc blend by spectroscope, and later, he was able to isolate the element.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named 'Gallium' after the Latin word for France, 'Gallia.' Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, the Frenchman who discovered gallium, named it after his homeland.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Gallium does not occur as a free element in nature and is commonly found in the ores of aluminum and zinc. It's extracted as a byproduct from the processing of these ores. Some gallium is also recovered from coal ash.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Gallium, the thirty-first element on the periodic table, is a soft, silvery metal at standard temperature and pressure. It has an unusual property of melting at slightly above room temperature (29.76 degrees Celsius or 85.57 degrees Fahrenheit), and it can be liquid near room temperature. Therefore, gallium can melt in your hand!</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Gallium is widely used in electronics, particularly in semiconductors as gallium arsenide. It's used in microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Gallium Nitride is a semiconductor used in blue and violet LEDs and diodes that emit laser light.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Gallium can react with other elements to form compounds. For instance, when gallium reacts with arsenic, it forms gallium arsenide, a compound widely used in semiconductors.</p>
