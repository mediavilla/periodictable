            <h1>Thallium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Thallium was discovered by British chemist Sir William Crookes in 1861, while he was making spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on residues from a sulfuric acid plant. The green spectral line that he spotted was from a new element, thallium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name thallium originates from the Greek word 'thallos', which means 'green twig' or 'green shoot', referring to the bright green spectral line which identified the new element.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Thallium is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust. It's found in trace amounts in many rocks and ores, particularly in association with sulfuric and heavy metal compounds. Thallium minerals are rather rare; the most common is lorandite (TlAsS2).</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Thallium is a soft, malleable, and highly toxic metal that resembles tin in physical appearance. Its melting point is 304°C, boiling point 1473°C, and its density is 11.85 g/cm³. Thallium is highly reactive and, if ingested, is extremely toxic to life forms.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Thallium is used in the electronics industry, in the manufacture of certain types of glass, and in medical imaging. It's also used in some types of infrared detectors. Due to its toxicity, its use has been reduced in many applications.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Thallium is not found as a free element in nature, but is extracted from minerals like lorandite and crookesite. Thallium can form compounds with various other elements, including sulfur, selenium, and iodine, amongst others. It also forms alloys with other metals.</p>
