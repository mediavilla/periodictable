            <h1>Indium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Indium was discovered by German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter in 1863. They found it while investigating zinc ores, noticing a bright indigo spectral line that hinted at an unknown element.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Indium' comes from the Latin word 'indicum', meaning 'indigo'. It was named this because of the indigo blue line in its spectrum that led to its discovery.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Indium is not often found in its pure form in nature. Instead, it's usually found in zinc, iron, lead, and copper ores. Most of the world's indium supply is extracted as a byproduct of zinc mining.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Indium is a soft, silvery-white metal with a bright luster. It's so soft you can easily cut it with a knife. Indium is unusual because it remains a metal at very low temperatures, making it useful for low-temperature applications like cryogenics and superconductivity.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Indium's most important application is in the creation of indium tin oxide, which is used in flat-panel displays and touch screens because it conducts electricity and is transparent. It's also used in solders, in nuclear reactors as a neutron absorber, and in LEDs.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Indium forms compounds with a variety of other elements. For example, when combined with tin, it forms indium tin oxide. It also forms a series of compounds with the halogens, called indium halides.</p>
