            <h1>Chlorine</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Chlorine was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who thought it was a compound rather than an element. It was later named and recognized as an element by Sir Humphry Davy in 1810.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Chlorine' comes from the Greek word 'chloros', which means greenish-yellow. It's a reference to the color of this gas.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Chlorine is never found in nature in its free state because it's highly reactive. However, it is widely distributed in the form of its compounds. The most common of these is sodium chloride, or common table salt, which can be found in sea water and salt pans.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Chlorine, the seventeenth element on the periodic table, is a greenish-yellow gas at room temperature. It has a strong, sharp smell and is poisonous. Chlorine is known for being a strong oxidizing agent.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Chlorine has many uses. Its most well-known application is in disinfecting drinking water and swimming pools. It's also extensively used in the production of many products such as paper products, dyestuffs, textiles, petroleum products, medicines, antiseptics, insecticides, food, solvents, paints, and plastics.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Chlorine is highly reactive and can combine with nearly all elements, producing chlorides. Notably, sodium chloride (table salt) is vital for human and animal life. Chlorine also plays a key role in organic chemistry as it can replace hydrogen in organic molecules, creating a range of organochlorine compounds.</p>
