            <h1>Aluminium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Aluminum was first isolated in 1825 by Danish chemist Hans Christian Ørsted. However, it was Friedrich Wöhler, a German chemist, who improved the isolation process in 1827, making it easier to produce the metal.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Aluminum' (American English) or 'Aluminium' (International English) comes from the Latin word 'alumen', meaning alum. Alum is a group of related compounds, the most common of which is potassium aluminum sulfate.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Aluminum is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up about 8% of it by weight. It is never found free in nature, but is found combined in over 270 different minerals, the most common of which is bauxite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Aluminum, the thirteenth element on the periodic table, is a silvery-white, ductile, and nonmagnetic metal. It's known for being lightweight yet strong. Aluminum is a good conductor of electricity and is highly resistant to corrosion due to the formation of a thin layer of aluminum oxide on its surface when exposed to air.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Aluminum has a wide range of uses. It's extensively used in the aerospace industry due to its light weight and strength. It's also used in the construction industry, in automobile manufacturing, in packaging (like aluminum cans), and in the production of electrical wires. Aluminum foil is a common household item.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Aluminum reacts with oxygen in the air to form aluminum oxide. This thin protective layer prevents further reaction and corrosion. It can react with both acids and bases and forms an array of compounds with other elements, many of which are important industrially.</p>
