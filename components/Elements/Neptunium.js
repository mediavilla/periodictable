            <h1>Neptunium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Neptunium was the first synthetic transuranium element of the actinide series discovered. It was discovered by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the University of California.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Neptunium was named after the planet Neptune, following the naming trend set by Uranium (named after Uranus) and the next planet outward from the Sun.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>While Neptunium is primarily synthetic and produced in nuclear reactors, trace amounts can be found in nature as a decay product of uranium or thorium. The long-lived isotope, Neptunium-237, is the most commonly observed isotope.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Neptunium is a silvery, radioactive, metallic element. It exists in at least three allotropic forms. All isotopes are radioactive, and the element is a nuclear waste product. Neptunium gradually accumulates in spent nuclear fuel over time.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Neptunium-237 can be used for the production of the isotope plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. It also has potential use in high-energy neutron detectors. However, due to its radioactivity and scarcity, it has no significant commercial applications.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Neptunium can form compounds with various other elements, often in several distinct chemical valences. It reacts with oxygen, hydrogen, halogens, and acids but not with alkalis. It can also form various inorganic compounds and organometallic compounds.</p>
