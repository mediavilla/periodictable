            <h1>Iodine</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Iodine was discovered by French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 while he was extracting sodium and potassium compounds from seaweed ash.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Iodine' comes from the Greek word 'iodes', which means 'violet'. This is because iodine vapor is a deep violet color.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Iodine is rare in the Earth's crust but is abundant in the oceans. Seawater contains about 50 parts per billion of iodine, and seaweeds can accumulate large amounts of it. It's usually extracted from natural brines and seaweeds or produced as a by-product of nitrate manufacturing.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Iodine is a halogen, which means it's a member of group 17 on the periodic table. It's a heavy, shiny, blackish-grey solid at room temperature. When heated, it sublimates into a purple vapor without melting, which is a characteristic feature of this element.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Iodine is widely used in medicine, photography, and dyes. It's essential for the production of thyroid hormones, and it's used as a disinfectant for water and in the treatment of wounds. Iodine is also used in the production of polarizing filters for LCD displays.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Iodine reacts with many elements and compounds. When it comes into contact with starch, it turns a deep blue, which is a common way to test for its presence. It reacts with hydrogen to form hydrogen iodide, a colorless gas that is a strong acid.</p>
