            <h1>Yttrium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Yttrium was discovered by Johan Gadolin, a Finnish chemist, in 1794 when he was analyzing the composition of a mineral found in a quarry near the Swedish village of Ytterby. Carl Gustav Mosander, a Swedish chemist, was able to isolate yttrium as a pure element in 1843.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Yttrium' is derived from the village of Ytterby, Sweden, where the mineral containing the element was first discovered.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals, as well as in uranium ores. It is commercially produced through the reduction of its fluoride with calcium metal.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Yttrium, the thirty-ninth element on the periodic table, is a silvery metallic transition metal. It is relatively stable in the air but will react with water and acids. Its compounds are often used in the making of phosphors to create the red color in television sets.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Yttrium has various uses. It is used in making phosphors for cathode ray tubes and red LEDs. Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) is used in lasers that can cut through metals. It is also used in certain camera lenses due to its optical properties.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Yttrium can form compounds with many other elements. It reacts with hot water and is soluble in dilute acids. When heated, it combines directly with halogens and sulfur. It also forms alloys with other transition metals and iron.</p>
