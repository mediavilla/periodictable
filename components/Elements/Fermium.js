            <h1>Fermium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Fermium was discovered in 1952 by a team of scientists led by Albert Ghiorso. It was found in the fallout from the first hydrogen bomb test, code-named "Ivy Mike". Due to the high secrecy surrounding the test, the discovery was not announced until 1955. The debris from the explosion was flown to laboratories where minute quantities of the elements were detected. It's notable because it was the first time that a thermonuclear explosion was used to synthesise new elements.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Fermium was named in honor of Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist who made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear physics, and the development of statistical mechanics. Fermi is often regarded as one of the leading scientists of the 20th century, and he is most notable for his work on the development of the first nuclear reactor.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Fermium does not naturally occur on Earth. It is a synthetic element that is produced in nuclear reactors and during nuclear tests.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Fermium is a radioactive, synthetic element. It's a member of the actinide series in period 7 of the periodic table. Fermium has 20 known isotopes, all of which are radioactive. The most stable isotope is fermium-257, with a half-life of about 100.5 days. It decays into californium-253 through alpha decay or into einsteinium-253 through electron capture.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Due to its instability and radioactivity, fermium has no known commercial applications. Its uses are limited to scientific research. Fermium-257 is used in the research of nuclear structure and for the synthesis of higher elements.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Fermium reacts with oxygen to form fermium(III) oxide (Fm2O3), and it can also form halides with halogens. However, due to its radioactivity and scarcity, reactions with many other elements have not been extensively studied.</p>
