            <h1>Carbon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Carbon is one of the few elements known to ancient civilizations and there is no record of a specific person discovering it. Charcoal, a form of carbon, was used thousands of years ago, and the Egyptians and Sumerians were familiar with its properties.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Carbon' comes from the Latin word 'carbo', which means 'coal'. This refers to one of the most common sources of carbon, which has been used as a fuel for centuries.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Carbon is a very abundant element in the universe and can be found in many different forms on Earth. It is found in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, in the ground as fossil fuels (like coal and petroleum), and in all living organisms. It is also found in its pure form as graphite and diamonds, and as part of countless compounds.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Carbon, the sixth element on the periodic table, has unique properties that make it different from other elements. It can bond with many other elements, including itself, which allows it to form millions of different compounds. It has several forms, called allotropes, including diamond (the hardest known mineral), graphite, and fullerene.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Carbon has a wide range of uses. It is used as a fuel in the form of coal, wood, and natural gas. Graphite is used in pencils, lubricants, and batteries. Diamonds are used in jewelry and in industrial applications for cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Carbon fiber is used for making various products like sports equipment, building materials, and aircraft parts because it's light and strong. Carbon also plays a key role in life on Earth, as it is a key component of biological compounds.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Carbon loves to interact with other elements. Its ability to form long chains and rings by bonding with itself allows it to form the backbone of organic molecules, which are the basis for all known life. It also readily bonds with oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, among others, to form millions of different compounds.</p>
