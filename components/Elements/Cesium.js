            <h1>Cesium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Cesium was discovered by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, two German scientists, in 1860. It was the first element to be discovered using a spectroscope.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Cesium' originates from the Latin word 'caesius', which means 'sky blue'. It was named for the blue lines in its spectrum.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Cesium is found in the Earth's crust at a concentration of about 1 part per million. It is often found in mineral water and as a component of certain minerals like pollucite and lepidolite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Cesium is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point so low that it can melt in the hand. It is one of five elemental metals that are liquid near room temperature. It's also highly reactive and will explode on contact with water.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Cesium is used in atomic clocks, which are incredibly accurate. It is also used in medical applications, oil drilling, and in the production of electricity.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Cesium is highly reactive. It reacts vigorously with oxygen and even more explosively with water. It also forms a number of compounds with elements like chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine.</p>
