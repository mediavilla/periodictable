            <h1>Holmium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Holmium was discovered in 1878 by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve. He found the new element in a mineral called erbia, which had been thought to contain only one new element but actually contained two: holmium and thulium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Holmium is named after the city of Stockholm, the home town of its discoverer, Per Teodor Cleve. In Latin, Stockholm is known as 'Holmia', hence the name 'Holmium'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Holmium is never found as a free element in nature, but is found in several minerals including monazite and gadolinite. It is usually mined from these minerals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Holmium is a rare-earth metal that is silvery-white in color. It is fairly soft and malleable, and is known to have the highest magnetic strength of any element, especially at low temperatures.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Holmium's strong magnetic properties make it valuable in a variety of applications. These include magnetic data storage, as a coloring agent in glass and cubic zirconia, and in extremely strong magnets used in scientific equipment. It's also used in medical lasers for procedures like eye and dental surgery.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>When alloyed with other elements, like yttrium and aluminium, holmium can be used to create highly magnetic compounds. These are utilized in the manufacturing of magnetic flux concentrators, which are used in solid-state physics experiments.</p>
