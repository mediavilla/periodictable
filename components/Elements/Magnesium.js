            <h1>Magnesium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Magnesium was first isolated by English chemist Sir Humphry Davy in 1808. He used a method known as electrolysis to extract magnesium from a compound called magnesia.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Magnesium' comes from the Greek region of Magnesia, where compounds of the element were originally discovered in mineral form.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the third most abundant element in seawater. It's not found in nature as a free element due to its high reactivity, but is found in compounds such as dolomite and carnallite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Magnesium, the twelfth element on the periodic table, is a shiny gray solid which closely resembles the other five elements in the second column (group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table. It is relatively strong, yet light, and it's known for its ability to ignite easily in air and burn with a brilliant white light.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Magnesium has many uses. Due to its lightness and strength, it's used in the manufacture of various lightweight materials and structures, like airplanes and cars. It's also used in the production of fireworks and marine flares because of its bright white light when burnt. In the medical field, magnesium is used both in medication and as a component in medical implants.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Magnesium reacts with many elements and compounds, such as oxygen and water, though not as vigorously as its group neighbors. When heated, it reacts with almost all the gases in the air. It forms compounds with a variety of elements, many of which are important in industry and biology.</p>
