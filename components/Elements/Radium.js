            <h1>Radium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Radium was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre in 1898 in pitchblende (a uranium rich ore) from North Bohemia. It was isolated in its pure metallic state through the electrolysis of radium chloride in 1911.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Radium comes from the Latin word 'radius', meaning ray. This is due to its intense radioactivity, emitting energetic rays of radiation.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Radium is found in minute quantities in the earth's crust. It occurs in uranium and (to a lesser extent) thorium ores. It's not commercially produced due to its radioactivity.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Radium is a silvery-white, shiny metal at room temperature. When freshly cut, it rapidly reacts with oxygen to form a black surface layer of radium oxide. It is an alkaline earth metal and the heaviest of them. It's over one million times more radioactive than the same mass of uranium.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Early in the 20th century, radium was used in self-luminous paints for watches, aircraft instrument dials and other instrumentation, but has largely been replaced by cobalt-60, a less dangerous radioactive source. A mixture of radium and beryllium will emit neutrons and is used as a neutron source. Radium was once an additive in products like toothpaste, hair creams, and even food items due to its supposed curative powers. These uses were ended when the harmful effects of radium were discovered.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Radium reacts readily with nitrogen on exposure to air, forming a black surface layer of radium nitride. It also reacts with water to form radium hydroxide and is more volatile than barium, becoming significantly volatile on heating to accomplish a reaction with dry oxygen at 400 Â°C.</p>
