            <h1>Mendelevium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Mendelevium was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory R. Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and Stanley G. Thompson in 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced the isotope Mendelevium-256 by bombarding an isotope of Einsteinium with alpha particles in the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley Lab.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Mendelevium was named in honor of Dmitri Mendeleev, the creator of the periodic table.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Mendelevium does not occur naturally on Earth. It is a synthetic element and can only be produced in a laboratory.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Mendelevium is a synthetic, highly radioactive metal. It is in the actinide series of the periodic table and it glows due to its high radioactivity. It has thirteen known isotopes, the most stable of which is Mendelevium-258 with a half-life of 51.5 days.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its extremely limited and expensive production, Mendelevium has no commercial applications. It is used only for scientific research purposes.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Like all synthetic elements, Mendelevium is highly reactive and unstable. It readily undergoes radioactive decay, but its chemistry has not been extensively explored due to the difficulty in producing and isolating it.</p>
