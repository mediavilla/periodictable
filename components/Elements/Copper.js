            <h1>Copper</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Copper was one of the first metals to be used by humans, and it has been utilized for over 10,000 years. The discovery of copper dates back to prehistoric times, and it was first used to make tools and weapons.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Copper' comes from the Latin word 'cuprum,' which means 'from the island of Cyprus.' In ancient times, a significant amount of copper was mined on the island, hence the name.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Copper is found as a native metal in nature, meaning it occurs in a directly usable metallic form. It's also found in various minerals such as azurite, malachite, and chalcopyrite. Major copper mines are located in Chile, Peru, and China.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Copper, the twenty-ninth element on the periodic table, is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Its distinctive reddish-orange color is well-known. Interestingly, its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d10 4s1, not [Ar] 3d9 4s2, as one might expect. This is because elements typically prefer to have either a half-filled or fully filled d sub-level for stability. Copper "borrows" one electron from the 4s level to fill the 3d level, creating a more stable arrangement.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Copper is used widely in numerous areas due to its excellent electrical conductivity. It's commonly used in electrical wires, roofing, plumbing, and industrial machinery. Additionally, it's used in the production of brass and bronze alloys.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Copper can form compounds with various elements. It forms two types of oxides when exposed to air and moisture. Copper(I) oxide (cuprous oxide) is red, and Copper(II) oxide (cupric oxide) is black. Copper reacts with most acids to form copper salts.</p>
