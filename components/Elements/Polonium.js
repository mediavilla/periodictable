            <h1>Polonium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Polonium was discovered by Marie Curie and her husband Pierre in 1898 in Paris, while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende's residual radioactivity after uranium and thorium had been removed. It was named after Marie Curie's homeland, Poland.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Polonium' originates from 'Polonia', the Latin word for 'Poland', which is Marie Curie's homeland. She named it this as a tribute and in recognition of her country of birth, which, at that time, did not exist as an independent state.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half-life of all its isotopes. It is found in uranium ores at about 100 micrograms per metric ton (1:1010). Its abundance is only about 0.2% of that of radium.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Polonium is a radioactive, rare, silvery-gray metal that is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium. It's highly dangerous due to its extreme radioactivity and has no stable isotopes. When exposed to air, it can spontaneously ignite and release toxic, radioactive gases.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its intense radioactivity, Polonium's applications are limited and mostly related to its ability to emit alpha particles. It's been used in devices like anti-static brushes and as a heat source in space probes. However, due to its high toxicity, its use has been largely discontinued.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Polonium reacts with halogens, forming polonium dihalides. It dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium's oxides PoO and PoO2 are the only well-characterized compounds.</p>
