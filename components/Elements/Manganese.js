            <h1>Manganese</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Manganese was discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist Johan Gottlieb Gahn by heating the mineral pyrolusite (MnO2) in the presence of charcoal.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Manganese' is derived from the Greek word for magic, 'magnes', due to its curious physical properties.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Manganese is not found as a free element in nature, but it's found in combination with iron and in many minerals. It is a common element in the Earth's crust and is present in many types of rocks.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Manganese, the twenty-fifth element on the periodic table, is a brittle, hard, grey-white metal that is chemically reactive. Manganese has a high melting point and is very common in the universe, being the twelfth most abundant element.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Manganese has many applications. It is an important steel additive and is crucial for the health of plants and animals. In steel production, manganese serves as a deoxidizing and desulfurizing agent. It is also used in making disposable batteries and aluminum cans. A common use is in the production of low-cost stainless steel.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Manganese reacts with most acids and alkalis, and it forms a wide range of oxidation states. It also combines with other elements in various ways, most commonly with carbon, silicon, and oxygen.</p>
