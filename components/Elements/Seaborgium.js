            <h1>Seaborgium</h1>

            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Seaborgium was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. They achieved this by bombarding a target made of californium-249 with oxygen-18 ions. In 1997, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially recognized the Lawrence Berkeley team as the discoverers of the element.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Seaborgium is named in honor of Glenn T. Seaborg, an American nuclear chemist who was involved in the discovery of several actinide elements and was a contributor to the development of the actinide concept in the periodic table. The naming was controversial at the time as the element was named while Seaborg was still alive, breaking the IUPAC's tradition of naming elements after deceased individuals.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Seaborgium is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It is produced in a laboratory setting through nuclear reactions.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Seaborgium is a member of the 7th period and is classified as a transition metal. The element is expected to be a solid at room temperature. Because of its short half-life and scarcity, the physical and chemical properties of seaborgium are not well-known. It is, however, predicted to behave similarly to the other Group 6 elements, particularly tungsten.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>As of now, seaborgium has no known applications outside of scientific research, primarily due to its instability and rarity.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>The chemical interactions of seaborgium are not well-studied due to its short half-life and scarcity. It is expected to be a highly reactive metal that could form various types of compounds with other elements.</p>
