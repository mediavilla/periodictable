            <h1>Darmstadtium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Darmstadtium (Ds) was first synthesized in 1994 by a team of scientists led by Sigurd Hofmann at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. They achieved this by bombarding a lead-208 target with nickel-62 ions.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element was named Darmstadtium in honor of the city of Darmstadt, Germany, where it was discovered. The city is home to the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, a leading research facility in nuclear physics.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Darmstadtium is not found naturally on Earth. It is a synthetic element that can only be produced in a laboratory.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Darmstadtium is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 10 elements in the periodic table. It is a superheavy element. Because of its extremely short half-life (about a tenth of a second), any Darmstadtium that is produced decays into other elements so quickly that there's never enough to see or study directly.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Darmstadtium has no known applications and is used only for scientific research purposes, primarily to learn more about the properties of superheavy elements.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Because of its extreme instability, there's little known about how Darmstadtium interacts with other elements. It is so rare and short-lived that it is difficult to gather much data on its behavior or characteristics.</p>
