            <h1>Californium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Californium was first synthesized in 1950 by Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding curium-242 with alpha particles in a cyclotron.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Californium was named after the U.S. state of California, where the University of California, Berkeley, the institution responsible for its discovery, is located.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Californium does not occur naturally on Earth and is only produced in nuclear reactors or in the laboratory. Traces of californium-252 were found in the atmosphere after nuclear weapons tests, but those quantities have now decayed and are essentially undetectable.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Californium is a radioactive metal and is a member of the actinide series. It is silvery-white in color and tarnishes when exposed to air. The isotope californium-252 is a very strong neutron emitter, which makes it extremely hazardous to handle.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Californium-252 has some important applications. It's used in neutron radiography to detect high-energy neutrons, in oil wells to detect water and oil layers, and in treatment of certain types of cancer. It's also used as a source of neutrons in research and in neutron moisture gauges for the determination of water and oil bearing layers in oil wells.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Californium reacts with oxygen to form Californium(III) oxide (Cf2O3), and with halogens to form californium halides. It can also form various compounds with other elements in which it commonly exhibits a +3 oxidation state, though a +2 state has also been observed.</p>
