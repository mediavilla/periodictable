            <h1>Protactinium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and O.H. GÃ¶hring, who found the isotope protactinium-234m. The more stable isotope, protactinium-231, was discovered in 1918 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. </p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>It was the first element to be named on the basis of its radioactive properties; the name "protactinium" was derived from the Greek 'protos', meaning 'first', and 'actinium', the name of the element that follows it in the periodic series. The 'first actinium' refers to the fact that protactinium decays into actinium as part of its radioactive decay series.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Protactinium is a rare and highly radioactive metal that is found in trace amounts in uranium ores. The most stable isotope, protactinium-231, has a half-life of about 32,760 years.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Protactinium is a bright, silvery metal that resists attack by oxygen, water vapor, and dry air, but is attacked by moist air, oxygen, and strong acids. It exists in two crystalline forms and has a melting point higher than that of actinium but lower than thorium.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Due to its scarcity, high radioactivity and toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic scientific research.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Protactinium is chemically reactive and forms various compounds. Protactinium metal tarnishes slowly in air, and it reacts with water, forming protactinium(IV) oxide and hydrogen. It also reacts with most non-metals at high temperatures.</p>
