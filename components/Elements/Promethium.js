            <h1>Promethium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Promethium was discovered in 1945 by scientists Jacob Marinsky, Lawrence Glendenin, and Charles Coryell at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States. The team extracted the element from fission products of uranium fuel that had been irradiated in a nuclear reactor.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element's name comes from 'Prometheus', the Titan from Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. This name was chosen because Promethium, as a radioactive material, releases energy.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Promethium is not typically found in nature. It is a product of uranium fission and is produced synthetically in nuclear reactors. Traces of it have been found in uranium ores and in the spectrum of a star.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Promethium is a radioactive element with no stable isotopes. It glows blue or green in the dark due to its high radioactivity and can be used as a source of light that doesn't require an external energy source.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Promethium has some interesting applications due to its radioactive properties. It's used in luminous paint, atomic batteries, and thickness measurement devices. It also has potential uses in portable X-ray devices and in radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for spacecraft.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>As a lanthanide, Promethium can form compounds with various other elements. However, due to its radioactivity, it doesn't often interact with other elements in common conditions.</p>
