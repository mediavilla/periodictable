            <h1>Niobium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Niobium was discovered by Charles Hatchett, an English chemist, in 1801. He found it in an American mineral sample, which he named columbite. However, confusion over the new element and its close relative tantalum led to many years of debate. Finally, the element was officially named niobium in 1950.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Niobium' comes from Niobe, the daughter of mythical Greek King Tantalus. The element's properties are similar to that of the element tantalum, named after the King, hence the connection.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Niobium is not found freely in nature, but it is found in minerals such as columbite and pyrochlore. Most of the world's niobium is produced in Brazil, although some also comes from Canada.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Niobium, the forty-first element on the periodic table, is a light, soft, grey, crystalline, ductile transition metal. Niobium has a high melting point and is resistant to many chemicals, making it useful for industrial purposes.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Niobium is primarily used in alloys to increase strength, heat resistance, and durability. It's used in pipeline construction, superconducting magnets, jet engines, and even rockets. Niobium oxide is used in camera lenses and other optical instruments due to its high refractive index.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Niobium is not particularly reactive. However, it can form compounds with oxygen, sulfur, and halogens at high temperatures. It can also form various alloys when combined with other metals.</p>
