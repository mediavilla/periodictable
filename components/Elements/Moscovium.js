            <h1>Moscovium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Moscovium (Mc) was first synthesized in 2003 by a team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. The team, led by Yuri Oganessian, created Moscovium by bombarding targets of americium with accelerated ions of calcium.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Moscovium was named in honor of the Moscow region, the location of the JINR. The name was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2016.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Moscovium is not found naturally on Earth. It is a synthetic element, produced in a laboratory.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Moscovium is a highly unstable and radioactive element. Its most stable known isotope, Moscovium-290, has a half-life of only about 0.8 seconds. Moscovium is predicted to be a heavy alkali metal, similar to its lighter homolog thallium.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Moscovium has no known applications and is used only in scientific research.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Moscovium's extreme instability and short half-life mean that there's limited information about its interactions with other elements. Its position in the periodic table suggests it might behave similarly to other heavy alkali metals, but these properties have yet to be thoroughly investigated.</p>
