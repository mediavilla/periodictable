            <h1>Bromine</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig and Antoine Jérôme Balard, in 1825 and 1826 respectively. Balard published his work first, and is generally given credit for the discovery.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named 'Bromine' from the Greek word 'bromos,' which means 'stench,' referring to the strong, unpleasant smell of this element.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Bromine is never found as a free element in nature due to its high reactivity. It is found in combined states as bromide salts within the earth's crust, evaporates salts, and seawater.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Bromine, the thirty-fifth element on the periodic table, is a heavy, volatile, corrosive, reddish-brown, non-metallic liquid. It's the only non-metallic element that is a liquid at room temperature. It has a strong and unpleasant odor and is toxic.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Bromine is used in many areas such as agricultural chemicals, dyestuffs, insecticides, pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates. Some uses are being phased out for environmental reasons. Bromine compounds can be used as flame retardants.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Bromine reacts with many elements and has a wide variety of compounds. It's very reactive, only less so than fluorine and chlorine. It reacts with many other elements to achieve a stable electron configuration, and with organics, it can act as a powerful brominating agent.</p>
