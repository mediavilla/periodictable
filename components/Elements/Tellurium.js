            <h1>Tellurium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Tellurium was discovered by Austrian mineralogist and scientist Franz-Joseph MÃ¼ller von Reichenstein in 1782 when he worked as the chief inspector of all mines, smelters, and saltworks in Transylvania.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Tellurium' comes from the Latin word 'tellus', which means 'earth'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Tellurium is usually found combined in over 100 types of minerals, but it's primarily recovered as a by-product of copper and lead refining. It's rarely found in its elemental form. It's often found combined with gold in a mineral called calaverite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Tellurium is a metalloid, meaning it has properties of both metals and nonmetals. It's brittle and easily pulverized. It has a shiny silver-white color, and its electrical conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Tellurium is used in alloys to improve their machinability. It's used in the manufacture of blasting caps for explosives and in thermoelectric devices. Tellurium is also used in the rubber industry to speed up the vulcanization process, and it's a key component in rewritable CDs and DVDs.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Tellurium can form compounds with a variety of other elements. For example, it reacts with hydrogen to form hydrogen telluride, a highly toxic compound. When alloyed with other metals, such as copper and stainless steel, it improves their machinability.</p>
