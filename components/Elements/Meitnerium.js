            <h1>Meitnerium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Meitnerium (Mt) was discovered by the German research team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany in 1982. They bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58. The team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried MÃ¼nzenberg officially reported the discovery in 1982.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named after Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner, who was a key figure in the discovery of nuclear fission.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Meitnerium is a synthetic element. It is not found naturally on Earth and is only produced in the laboratory in minuscule quantities through nuclear reactions.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Meitnerium is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the transactinide elements. It is expected to be a transition metal. As of 2021, there is no sufficient amount of Meitnerium to weigh it or see it with the naked eye, and it has never been observed to have any impact on the human body or the environment due to its short half-life.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its extremely short half-life and scarcity, Meitnerium has no known uses outside of basic scientific research.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Due to its instability and rarity, the chemical characteristics of Meitnerium are largely unknown. It is expected to behave similarly to its lighter homologues in the group, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.</p>
