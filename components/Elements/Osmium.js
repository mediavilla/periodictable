            <h1>Osmium</h1>

            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Osmium was discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant in London, England. He found it in the residue left when raw platinum was dissolved in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid).</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Osmium is derived from the Greek word 'osme' meaning smell, because of the pungent odor of its tetroxide.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Osmium is found in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; especially the iridium-osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). It's also found in the residues from platinum extraction.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Osmium is a hard, brittle, blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum group and is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of 22.59 g/cmÂ³. It is also the element with the highest melting point. Osmium is inert to most chemicals and is usually found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in platinum ores.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Osmium is used in alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum-group metals. These alloys are employed in fountain pen tips, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed. Osmium tetroxide has been used in fingerprint detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>At normal temperatures, osmium is unaffected by water and air, but it oxidizes and becomes volatile at high temperatures, forming a toxic, volatile compound osmium tetroxide.</p>
