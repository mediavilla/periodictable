            <h1>Lanthanum</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Lanthanum was discovered by a Swedish chemist named Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839. He discovered it when he was investigating a mineral called cerite.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Lanthanum' is derived from the Greek word 'lanthaneia', which means 'to lie hidden'. This is a nod to its hidden presence in cerite.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Lanthanum is found in rare earth minerals such as monazite and bastn√§site. It is usually obtained commercially from these minerals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Lanthanum is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal. It is one of the so-called "Rare Earth Metals" and is quite reactive, rapidly tarnishing in the air and reacting with water to form Lanthanum hydroxide.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Lanthanum is often used in the production of carbon arc lights which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights. It is also used in the manufacturing of special optical glasses, such as infrared-absorbing glass, camera and telescope lenses.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Lanthanum reacts directly with carbon, nitrogen, boron, selenium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and with halogens. It also reacts with water to form Lanthanum hydroxide.</p>
