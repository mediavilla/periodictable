            <h1>Astatine</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Astatine was discovered in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, K. R. Mackenzie, and Emilio Segr√® at the University of California, Berkeley. They created it by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles in a particle accelerator.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Astatine is derived from the Greek 'astatos', which means 'unstable', reflecting the element's extremely unstable nature due to its radioactivity and short half-life.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element that is not a transuranic element, with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than 1 ounce (28 grams) at any given time. It is produced by the decay of various heavier elements and is usually found in minute quantities in uranium and thorium ores.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Astatine is a highly radioactive element and is the heaviest member of the halogen group. Due to its short half-life and intense radioactivity, it's challenging to gather enough of it to study its properties, but it's thought to resemble iodine and other halogens in many ways. It's likely to appear as a black or metallic-looking solid if viewed in large enough quantities.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its extreme rarity and radioactivity, Astatine has no significant industrial applications. It has potential use in targeted alpha-particle therapy in medicine, but this is still in experimental stages.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>As a halogen, Astatine is expected to form salts with metals and reactive nonmetals. However, its extreme radioactivity makes it difficult to work with, limiting the study of its chemical properties.</p>
