            <h1>Thulium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Thulium was discovered by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879. He found it while searching for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements. He was able to identify two new elements, one of which was thulium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named after Thule, an ancient place name for Scandinavia.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Thulium is not found free in nature, but it can be found in smaller amounts in minerals that also contain other lanthanides. It's often found in the earth's crust and in minerals like gadolinite, monazite, and xenotime.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Thulium is a bright, silvery metal that's malleable and soft enough to be cut with a knife. It's the second least abundant of the naturally occurring lanthanides.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Because thulium is rare and expensive, it has few commercial uses. However, it's used in lasers for medical and meteorological purposes, and as a radiation source in portable X-ray devices. It also has potential uses in magnetic materials.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Thulium compounds react with a wide variety of other elements to form various compounds, used in a range of applications from catalysts to ceramics.</p>
