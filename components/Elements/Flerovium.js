            <h1>Flerovium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Flerovium (Fl) was first synthesized in 1998 by a team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. The team, led by Yuri Oganessian, created Flerovium by bombarding targets of plutonium with accelerated nuclei of calcium.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element was named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, itself named after Soviet physicist Georgy Flerov, a pioneer in heavy-ion physics.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Flerovium is not found naturally on Earth. It is a synthetic element, produced in a lab.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>As a synthetic element, Flerovium doesn't have many known properties, as it's only been produced in small amounts and is highly unstable. Its most stable isotope, Flerovium-289, has a half-life of only about 2.6 seconds.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Flerovium has no known applications outside of basic scientific research, largely due to its extreme rarity and instability.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Due to its extreme instability and short half-life, there's limited information about Flerovium's interactions with other elements. Its position in the periodic table suggests it might behave similarly to the other elements in Group 14, but these properties have yet to be thoroughly investigated.</p>
