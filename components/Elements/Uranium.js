            <h1>Uranium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Uranium was discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in the mineral pitchblende (uraninite). However, it wasn't until 1841 that French physicist Eugène-Melchior Péligot isolated the pure element. The existence of the isotopes U-235 and U-238 was established in 1935.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Uranium was named after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered just eight years earlier by William Herschel.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Uranium is relatively common in the Earth's crust, being 40 times more common than silver and 500 times more common than gold. It occurs in most rocks, especially granite and limestone, and in seawater. Uranium-238 is the most common isotope, making up over 99% of natural uranium, while Uranium-235, the isotope useful for nuclear fission, makes up about 0.72%.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Uranium is a heavy, silvery-white metal, and it's the heaviest naturally occurring element on Earth. It's highly reactive and can form a large number of compounds. The metal is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>The primary use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20 trillion joules of energy (as much as 1500 tonnes of coal). Uranium is also used in the production of nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium, primarily consisting of uranium-238, is used in armor-piercing ammunition and as a shielding material.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Uranium is a highly reactive metal that can form compounds with all non-metallic elements except the noble gases. It reacts with almost all nonmetals, including sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and with many metals.</p>
