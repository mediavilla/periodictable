            <h1>Ruthenium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Ruthenium was discovered in 1844 by Russian chemist Karl Ernst Claus. He found it in the residue of platinum ores remaining after dissolution in aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Ruthenium' comes from 'Ruthenia', the Latin word for Russia, Claus's home country.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Ruthenium is found in small but measurable amounts in certain types of ores along with other platinum group metals. It's typically found in Russia, North America, and South America.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Ruthenium, the forty-fourth element on the periodic table, is a hard, white metal. It does not tarnish at room temperature, is not attacked by hot or cold acids, and is resilient to aqua regia.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Ruthenium is used in many high-technology applications due to its excellent hardness and resistance to corrosion. It's used in electronics for chip resistors and electrical contacts, and in the chemical industry as a catalyst.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Ruthenium can form an array of oxidation states from -2 to +8, allowing it to interact with a wide range of other elements. Its compounds are often used in catalysis and electronics.</p>
