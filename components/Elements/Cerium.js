            <h1>Cerium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Cerium was discovered in 1803 by both Klaproth and Berzelius, two renowned chemists. They found it independently within the same year while working on an ore of cerium now known as cerite.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Cerium' is derived from the name of the dwarf planet Ceres, which was discovered just two years prior to cerium.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Cerium is the most abundant of the rare-earth metals and is found in a number of minerals including allanite (also known as orthite), monazite, bastnasite, cerite, and samarskite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Cerium is a soft, ductile, and silvery-white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the second element of the lanthanide series.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Cerium is used in various applications such as in carbon-arc lighting, especially in the motion picture industry. It's also a crucial component of misch metal, used in the manufacturing of lighter flints. Cerium oxide is used as a catalytic converter for the minimization of CO emissions in the automotive industry.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Cerium readily reacts with oxygen and water. When mixed with iron, it creates flints for a lighter due to its pyrophoric nature, which means it can ignite spontaneously at room temperature.</p>
