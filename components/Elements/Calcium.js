            <h1>Calcium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Calcium was discovered in 1808 by English scientist Sir Humphry Davy, who isolated it through the electrolysis of a mixture of lime (CaO) and mercuric oxide (HgO).</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Calcium' comes from the Latin word 'calx', which means lime. Lime (CaO) was known from ancient times and was the primary material used in the production of Calcium.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, present in large amounts in sedimentary rocks such as limestone, marble, chalk, and gypsum. It is also found in smaller amounts in many living organisms, including the human body where it is the most abundant mineral.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Calcium, the twentieth element on the periodic table, is a silver-gray metal. Although it is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, it never occurs in its elemental state in nature because it reacts easily with water and atmospheric oxygen.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Calcium has many uses. It's most commonly seen in the form of lime (used in construction), plaster of Paris (in plaster and ceramics), limestone (used in cement), and marble. Calcium is also used in the reduction of other metals and in the making of cheese, where it promotes the development of a firm curd. In the human body, calcium is vital for the health of bones and teeth.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Calcium is quite reactive and forms compounds with many other elements. When exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen to form calcium oxide (lime). It reacts with water more slowly than sodium and potassium. It also forms compounds with the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) and with sulfur.</p>
