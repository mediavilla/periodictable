            <h1>Barium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Barium was first identified in 1774 by Carl Scheele, a Swedish chemist. However, it was not isolated until 1808 by an English chemist named Sir Humphry Davy.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Barium' comes from the Greek word 'barys', which means 'heavy'. It was named so due to the high density of some of its ores.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Barium is not found naturally in its pure metallic form due to its reactivity with air. It's usually found combined with other elements, most commonly in the mineral barite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Barium is a soft, silvery metal that is very reactive. It quickly turns black in air due to oxidation and reacts vigorously with water to produce barium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Barium is used in many ways such as in the production of fireworks to give a green color, in medical procedures for imaging the digestive system, and in the manufacture of glass and ceramics.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Barium reacts with almost all the non-metals, forming a series of compounds. It readily reacts with air, and in particular, it reacts violently with water, releasing hydrogen gas.</p>
