            <h1>Iridium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Iridium was discovered by English chemist Smithson Tennant in 1803. He found it in the residue left when raw platinum was dissolved in aqua regia. The discovery was made in London, England.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Iridium is derived from the Greek goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the many colors of its salts.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. It's found uncombined in nature or in natural alloys, especially the iridium-osmium alloys, osmiridium (osmium rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). It is also often found with the other platinum group metals in alluvial deposits.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Iridium is a hard, brittle, lustrous, dense, transition metal of the platinum family. It is silvery-white and it's the second densest element, after osmium. Iridium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known and it resists attack by any acid. Iridium is generally credited with being the second densest element (after osmium).</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Iridium is used in making high-temperature apparatus, electrical contacts, and in the production of heavy-duty electrical contacts. Because of its high melting point and its resistance to heat and wear, iridium is used in spark plugs, and in the electrodes for the chlor-alkali process. Iridium crucibles are used for growing large high-quality single crystals.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Iridium is not known to be used by any life forms and it's not toxic, but its compounds should be handled with care due to the metal's radioactivity. Powdered iridium metal can be a fire hazard and, when heated in air, it can turn into iridium oxide.</p>
