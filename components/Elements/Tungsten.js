            <h1>Tungsten</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Tungsten was discovered by two Spanish chemists, the de Elhujar brothers, Juan Jos√© and Fausto, in 1783. They found an acid in wolframite that they succeeded in reducing to the elemental metal with charcoal.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Tungsten comes from the Swedish words 'tung sten', which mean 'heavy stone'. It's a reference to the mineral tungstate, which is very heavy. It's also known as Wolfram in many parts of the world, from the mineral wolframite in which it was originally discovered.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Tungsten is not found free in nature. It can be found in the minerals wolframite, scheelite, huebnertie and ferberite. Most of the world's tungsten resources are found in China.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Tungsten is a hard, steel-gray to tin-white metal, known for having the highest melting point of any pure metal at an impressive 3422 degrees Celsius. Its high melting point gives it excellent high-temperature mechanical properties.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Tungsten is most commonly used in products like light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes, radiation shielding, and in various industrial tools and machinery. It's also used in the military for projectiles that are designed to penetrate armor.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Tungsten forms chemical compounds with many elements, but it's most commonly seen in combination with oxygen, forming tungsten oxide, and with carbon, forming tungsten carbide. Both of these compounds are incredibly hard and are used in various industrial applications.</p>
