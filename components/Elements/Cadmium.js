            <h1>Cadmium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Cadmium was discovered in 1817 by German chemist Friedrich Stromeyer. He found it as an impurity in zinc oxide, and he was struck by the bright yellow color it produced when heated.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Cadmium' comes from the Latin word 'cadmia', which means 'calamine' (a mineral containing zinc carbonate). It was named after the mineral in which it was found.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Cadmium is not found free in nature, but is most often found in the earth's crust, associated with zinc ores. It's also found in small amounts in sphalerite, a common zinc mineral.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Cadmium, atomic number 48, is a soft, bluish-white metal. It's similar to zinc and mercury in its structure and properties. Cadmium is resistant to corrosion and is used in batteries due to its excellent electrochemical properties.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Cadmium's primary use is in the manufacturing of nickel-cadmium batteries. It's also used in pigments due to its vibrant color, in electroplating, and as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors. However, because it's toxic, its use is becoming less common in favor of safer alternatives.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Cadmium can form a variety of compounds with other elements. One of the most common is cadmium sulfide, a yellow compound used as a pigment. In addition, cadmium forms an important series of compounds with chlorine, bromine, and iodine, known as cadmium halides.</p>
