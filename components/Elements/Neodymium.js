            <h1>Neodymium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by Austrian scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who also discovered Praseodymium. He separated Neodymium and Praseodymium from a material called didymium using a technique called repeated fractional crystallization.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Neodymium' comes from the Greek words 'neos' and 'didymos' which mean 'new twin'. This name reflects the fact that Neodymium was discovered alongside its 'twin', Praseodymium.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Neodymium is not found free in nature, but is found in a variety of minerals, including monazite and bastnasite. These minerals are a significant source of rare earth metals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Neodymium is a soft, silvery metal that tarnishes in air. It is one of the more reactive rare-earth metals and quickly oxidizes in air. Neodymium also has significant magnetic properties.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>The largest use of Neodymium is in powerful, permanent magnets. Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact magnets, such as microphones, professional loudspeakers, in-ear headphones, guitar and bass guitar pick-ups, and computer hard disks. Neodymium is also used to color glasses and ceramics, and in lasers that are used for laser cutting and welding.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Neodymium reacts quickly with oxygen to form Nd2O3, which has a lavender color. It also reacts with halogens to form trihalides.</p>
