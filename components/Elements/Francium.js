            <h1>Francium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Francium was discovered in 1939 by Marguerite Perey, a French physicist, in the Curie Institute, Paris. She discovered it while studying actinium's decay sequence, and it was the last naturally occurring element to be discovered.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Francium was named after France, the home country of its discoverer Marguerite Perey.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Francium is a very rare element and is found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores. It is the second rarest naturally occurring element (following astatine), and most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of less than a minute.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Francium is a highly radioactive metal. It has one of the lowest electronegativities of all known elements, and is the second least electronegative element, next to cesium. Its appearance is expected to be silvery or gray, but because of its instability and rarity, a large enough sample has never been assembled to confirm this.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its rarity and instability, francium has no commercial applications. It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry and of atomic structure studies.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>As with other alkali metals, francium would be expected to form +1 ions and have similar chemical properties to other elements in its group. However, francium's short half-life and scarcity makes it difficult to carry out any substantial chemical experiments on it.</p>
