            <h1>Krypton</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, while they were studying liquefied air. Small amounts of liquid krypton remained behind after the more volatile components of liquid air had boiled away.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Krypton' originates from a Greek word 'Kryptos,' which means 'hidden.'</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Krypton is present in the air at about 1 ppm. The element is more plentiful in Earth's atmosphere than in its crust. Krypton is also found in minerals and meteorites, but it's most commonly obtained from the air as a byproduct of the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Krypton, the thirty-sixth element on the periodic table, is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas. It can be condensed into a white crystalline solid. Krypton is one of the rarest gases in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Krypton is used in a variety of practical applications. It's used in some types of photographic flashes in photography. It is also used in lighting products. When combined with other gases, it can provide a bright white light. 'Krypton filled' bulbs are more energy efficient. The isotope krypton-86 was formerly used to define the meter.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Being a noble gas, Krypton does not readily form compounds with other elements. However, under certain extreme conditions, it can form compounds with fluorine. These are known as krypton fluorides.</p>
