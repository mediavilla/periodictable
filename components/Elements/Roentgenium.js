            <h1>Roentgenium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Roentgenium (Rg) was first created in 1994 by an international team of scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The element was produced by bombarding a bismuth-209 target with nickel-64 ions.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named in honor of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, the German physicist who discovered X-rays in 1895. Röntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Roentgenium does not occur naturally. It is a synthetic element that is produced in a laboratory.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Roentgenium is a member of group 11 in the periodic table. It is a highly unstable and radioactive element that only exists for a very short time before decaying into other elements. The element's most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of approximately 2.1 minutes.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>There are no known uses for roentgenium outside of basic scientific research. Due to its extreme radioactivity and short half-life, it's not used in any commercial applications.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Due to its extreme instability and short half-life, the chemical properties of roentgenium are not well understood. However, it is expected to behave similarly to other elements in its group, like copper, silver, and gold.</p>
