            <h1>Technetium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Technetium was officially discovered in 1937 by Italian scientists Emilio Segr√® and Carlo Perrier. They found it in a sample of molybdenum that had been bombarded with deuterium, a type of hydrogen, in a particle accelerator. This was the first element to be artificially produced, hence its name.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Technetium' comes from the Greek word 'technetos' which means 'artificial', referencing its synthetic creation.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Technetium does not occur naturally on Earth due to its high radioactivity and short half-life. However, it can be created artificially in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Technetium, the forty-third element on the periodic table, is a silvery-grey metal that tarnishes slowly in moist air. This element is radioactive and has no stable isotopes.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>The most common use of technetium is in medical imaging. Its isotope, Technetium-99m, is used as a radioactive tracer material in humans. It is also used in research and in equipment calibration for radioactivity detectors.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>At elevated temperatures, technetium reacts with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. It does not combine directly with hydrogen or nitrogen. With other metals, technetium forms a variety of compounds that can be used in research and other applications.</p>
