            <h1>Molybdenum</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Molybdenum was discovered in 1778 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Scheele realized that the mineral molybdenite, previously assumed to be lead, was in fact an ore containing a new element. However, it was not isolated until 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm, also a Swedish chemist.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Molybdenum' originates from the Greek word 'molybdos,' which means lead. This is because molybdenite, the ore from which it was first discovered, was originally mistaken for a lead compound.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Molybdenum is not found freely in nature. It is often found in the minerals molybdenite and wulfenite. The world's largest producers of molybdenum are China, the United States, and Chile.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Molybdenum, the forty-second element on the periodic table, is a silvery-white, very hard transition metal, but is softer and more ductile than tungsten. It has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Molybdenum is used in various applications, including aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors, and filaments. Its compounds also have important uses, such as in pigments and catalysts. Additionally, it's an essential element for plant life and is used as a fertilizer.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Molybdenum is not particularly reactive and does not react with oxygen or water at room temperature. However, it can form a variety of compounds when reacted with other elements at higher temperatures.</p>
