            <h1>Boron</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Boron was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy, Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, and Louis Jacques Thénard in 1808. These chemists were able to produce boron by reacting boric acid with potassium. However, it was not until 1909 that American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub was able to produce pure, crystalline boron.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Boron' comes from a combination of two Arabic words "buraq" and the Persian word "burah"; these are the words for the mineral borax, which is a common source of boron.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Boron is not found free in nature. It typically exists in compounds with oxygen and other elements. One of the most common sources of boron on Earth is the mineral borax. Turkey and the United States are the largest producers of boron today.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Boron is a metalloid, which means it has properties of both metals and non-metals. It is a low-abundance element in both the Earth's crust and the solar system. It's a tough element – second only to diamond in hardness. In its crystalline form, boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Boron has many uses. It's used in rocket fuel igniters, in the manufacture of borosilicate glass (which is resistant to heat and chemical reactions), and also in the production of fiberglass for insulation. Additionally, boron is used in the creation of strong, lightweight materials for airplanes and sporting equipment, and in the control rods of nuclear reactors.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Boron has the ability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks, making it similar to carbon. It's commonly found in compounds with oxygen. One of its interesting characteristics is its ability to absorb neutrons without forming radioactive isotopes, which makes it valuable in the control rods of nuclear reactors.</p>
