            <h1>Copernicium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Copernicium (Cn) was first created in February 1996 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The team was led by Sigurd Hofmann and Peter Armbruster. They created the element by bombarding lead-208 with zinc-70.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element was named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who formulated a model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at the center of the universe.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Copernicium is a synthetic element, and thus, it does not occur naturally. It is produced in a laboratory setting through nuclear reactions.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Copernicium is a member of the 12th group of the periodic table and it's a transition metal. It is extremely radioactive and has only been produced in very small amounts. It is thought to be a gas at room temperature, which would make it unique among the heavier elements that are solid under normal conditions.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>As of 2021, copernicium has no known uses outside of scientific research, largely due to its instability and rarity.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>The chemical properties of copernicium are not well understood due to its extreme instability and rarity. However, it's thought to behave similarly to its lighter homologues in group 12 of the periodic table.</p>
