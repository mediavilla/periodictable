            <h1>Gold</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Gold has been known to humankind and used by artisans since at least 5000 BC. It is one of the first metals to be used by humans, mainly because it is found in a native and functional state, not requiring any extraction or smelting.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name "Gold" comes from the Old English word "geolu," which means yellow. Its chemical symbol, Au, comes from the Latin word for Gold, 'Aurum', which means 'shining dawn' or 'glow of sunrise'. The phrase 'all that glitters is not gold' is a well-known saying, meaning that not everything that looks precious or true turns out to be so.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Gold is distributed widely over the earth, and gold mining is pursued in most countries with some success. It is often found in veins with quartz and various sulfides such as pyrite, but can also be found as grains or flakes in alluvial deposits.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Gold is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Gold is used for jewelry, investments, and for advanced technological applications. Its conductivity makes it a vital component in electronics, and its luster and resistance to tarnish make it popular for use in jewelry and coinage. In medicine, radioactive gold is used in diagnosis. It is also used in the protective coatings found on many satellites, as it is a good reflector of infrared and is chemically unreactive.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Gold is unaffected by air, heat, moisture and most solvents. It does not react with oxygen at any temperature and, up to 100 Â°C, it is resistant to water and most acids. Gold does react with halogens. It will, for example, react very slowly with chlorine gas at room temperature to form gold chloride, AuCl3. If gold chloride is heated gently, it will decompose to release the pure elements again.</p>
