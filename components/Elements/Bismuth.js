            <h1>Bismuth</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Bismuth was discovered by an unknown alchemist around 1400 AD. Early alchemists confused bismuth with tin and lead due to its resemblance to those elements.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'bismuth' originates from the German 'Wismuth,' meaning 'white mass'. Its symbol, Bi, comes from its Latin name 'bismuthum' or 'bisemutum'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Bismuth is not very abundant in nature and is typically obtained as a by-product of mining and refining lead, copper, tin, silver, and gold. Pure bismuth is quite rare.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Bismuth is a brittle, crystalline, white metal with a slight pink hue. It has a very low thermal conductivity and is both diamagnetic and the most naturally diamagnetic of all metals. Bismuth has one of the lowest levels of thermal conductivity among metals, which makes it useful in some alloys. Another notable property of Bismuth is its unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Bismuth has been used in solders, a variety of other alloys, metallurgical additives, and medications (particularly for gastrointestinal ailments). Bismuth compounds are also used as pigments and cosmetics.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Bismuth is stable in air and water, but it can react with concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It forms various compounds with other elements, including several oxides, halides, and sulfides.</p>
