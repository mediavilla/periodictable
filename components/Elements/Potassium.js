            <h1>Potassium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Potassium was discovered in 1807 by English scientist Sir Humphry Davy, who used electrolysis to isolate it from caustic potash (KOH).</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Potassium' comes from the English word 'potash', meaning pot ashes, and the Arabic word 'qali', meaning alkali. The symbol 'K' comes from the Latin word 'kalium'. The connection to potash comes from the old method of producing potassium by leaching wood ashes and evaporating the solution in pots.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Potassium is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is found in many minerals. It is also an essential element in the human body and is found in various foods, such as bananas.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Potassium, the nineteenth element on the periodic table, is a soft, silver-white metal that is so reactive it must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air. It reacts vigorously with water to produce hydrogen gas.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Potassium has many uses. The most significant use is in fertilizers as potassium is an essential nutrient for plant growth. Other applications include the production of soaps and detergents, as a heat exchange medium in nuclear power plants, and in certain types of glass and photographic chemicals.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Potassium is highly reactive, particularly with water, and also reacts with many acids. It forms compounds with other elements easily, creating various salts when reacted with halogens. Despite its reactivity, it's an essential element for life, playing key roles in nerve function and muscle control in animals, including humans.</p>
