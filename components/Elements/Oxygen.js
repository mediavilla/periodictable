            <h1>Oxygen</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, a Swedish chemist, in 1772 and Joseph Priestley, an Englishman, in 1774. However, Priestley is often given priority because he published his findings first.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Oxygen' comes from the Greek words 'oxys', which means 'acid' or 'sharp', and 'genes', which means 'producer'. This name was chosen by French chemist Antoine Lavoisier because he mistakenly thought oxygen was necessary to form all acids.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe and makes up about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere. It is also found in the Earth's crust, in the oceans as a component of water, and is a major component of all known life forms.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Oxygen, the eighth element on the periodic table, is a nonmetal. It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas in its pure form. Oxygen is highly reactive and forms compounds with almost all other elements. It is paramagnetic, meaning it is weakly attracted to a magnetic field, but does not remain magnetized once the field is removed.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Oxygen has a wide range of uses. It is necessary for all forms of combustion, so it's used in engines, furnaces, torches, and in medical applications for patients who require supplemental oxygen. It's also used in steel production and in the creation of other metals. Oxygen is also crucial in life processes such as respiration and photosynthesis.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Oxygen loves to react with other elements to form oxides. These reactions often release energy, which is why oxygen is important for combustion and respiration. Oxygen also reacts with many compounds to form new compounds in a process called oxidation.</p>
