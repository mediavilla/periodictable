            <h1>Rhenium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. It was found by Walter Noddack, Ida Tacke, and Otto Berg in Germany in 1925. They detected it in platinum ores and in the mineral columbite.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Rhenium originates from the Latin word 'Rhenus', meaning 'Rhine'. It's a reference to Germany, the homeland of its discoverers.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Rhenium is not found free in nature or as a compound in a distinct mineral species. Itâ€™s usually found in small amounts in other minerals, typically in concentrations of 0.001% or less.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Rhenium is a silvery-white metal with one of the highest melting points of all elements, exceeded only by Tungsten and Carbon. It also has one of the highest boiling points and is very hard, dense, and corrosion-resistant.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Rhenium is widely used as an alloying element for superalloys in turbine blades for jet aircrafts and rocket engines, and in thermocouples. Its radioisotopes are also used in the treatment of liver cancer.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Rhenium forms a range of compounds with other elements. One interesting partnership is with Platinum. Together, they form catalysts used in the production of high-octane unleaded gasoline.</p>
