            <h1>Sodium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Sodium was first isolated by English chemist Humphry Davy in 1807. He accomplished this through the process of electrolysis on dried sodium hydroxide, which was commonly known as caustic soda.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Sodium' comes from the English word 'soda'. The element's symbol, Na, comes from the Latin word 'natrium', which in turn comes from the Arabic word 'natrun', referring to a naturally occurring mineral salt.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and it's primarily found in salts like sodium chloride (table salt). It's also found in many minerals and in the world's oceans, which are a major source of sodium chloride.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Sodium, the eleventh element on the periodic table, is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. It's so soft that it can be cut with a knife. It's very reactive with water, to which it responds by producing sodium hydroxide, hydrogen gas, and a notable amount of heat. Sodium ions play a vital role in biological systems.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Sodium has many uses. It is best known for its dietary role as a component of table salt. Sodium compounds are used in glass production, paper production, textiles, and a variety of other industries. Sodium vapor lamps are used for street lighting in many cities due to their yellow light.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Sodium is highly reactive, particularly with water, and also reacts with many other elements. It reacts with acids to produce salts and hydrogen gas. Sodium also plays well with halogens, and reacts with them to form salts like sodium chloride and sodium iodide.</p>
