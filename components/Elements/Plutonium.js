            <h1>Plutonium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Plutonium was first produced and isolated in December 1940 by a team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The team was led by Glenn T. Seaborg and Edwin McMillan.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Plutonium was named after Pluto, following the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets. At the time of its discovery, Pluto was considered the next planet beyond Neptune.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Plutonium is not found in significant quantities in nature. It is a synthetic element that is produced in nuclear reactors from uranium-238.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Plutonium is a radioactive, metallic chemical element. It is silvery in appearance but tarnishes quickly to a dull gray when exposed to air. Plutonium is a highly toxic and reactive element. It has several allotropic forms, which have different crystal structures and thus different physical properties.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Plutonium-239, one of its isotopes, is used in most modern nuclear weapons. It's also used as a fuel in nuclear reactors. Plutonium-238 has been used to power spacecraft, particularly those that travel too far from the Sun to use solar power, such as the Voyager and New Horizons probes.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Plutonium is a reactive element and can form compounds with most other elements. However, due to its high radioactivity, plutonium and its compounds should be handled with great care.</p>
