            <h1>Cobalt</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Cobalt was discovered in 1735 by Swedish chemist Georg Brandt, who was trying to prove that the blue color in glass was not due to the presence of bismuth, as was believed at the time. It turned out he was right!</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Cobalt' comes from the German word 'kobold', which means 'goblin' or 'evil spirit'. The term was used by miners who were superstitiously reluctant to disturb the 'kobolds' by mining.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Cobalt is not found as a free element in nature, but it is found in minerals in the Earth's crust. Cobalt is also found in meteorites. Major deposits of cobalt are located in Canada, Morocco, and the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Cobalt, the twenty-seventh element on the periodic table, is a hard, lustrous, silver-grey metal. Under normal conditions, it is stable, but when powdered it is reactive. Cobalt has magnetic properties similar to those of iron and is capable of withstanding high temperatures.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Cobalt is used in many applications, such as in superalloys for jet engines, chemicals (paint dryers, adhesives, etc.), and magnets. It is also important for human nutrition as it's a key constituent of vitamin B12.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Cobalt can form compounds with various elements. In the presence of oxygen, cobalt can form a variety of oxides. It's reactive with halogens and acids but stable in air and unaffected by water at room temperature.</p>
