            <h1>Iron</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Iron has been known and used by humans for thousands of years. The Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had iron as early as 4000 BC. However, it wasn't until the 15th century that pure metallic iron was first produced on a larger scale by blasting furnace methods.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Iron' comes from the Old English 'iren', and is related to Scandinavian 'iarn' and 'isarn', all meaning 'holy metal' or 'strong metal'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and it exists in various ores including hematite and magnetite. Iron is also the most abundant (by mass, 34.6%) element making up the Earth; the concentration of iron in the various layers of the Earth ranges from high at the inner core to about 5% in the outer crust.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Iron, the twenty-sixth element on the periodic table, is a lustrous, silvery metal that is malleable and ductile. It is attracted to magnets and itself can be magnetized (ferromagnetism).</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Iron's most significant usage is in making steel, an alloy of iron and carbon. This material is used in a wide range of applications, from construction to automobile manufacturing. Iron is also used as a catalyst in the production of ammonia and for making pigments. Furthermore, it is used in appliances and utensils, in the form of stainless steel, which is an iron alloy with added elements.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Iron can form compounds with various elements. When it comes into contact with oxygen and water, it forms a brown coating of hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. It also forms various other oxides and it reacts with most acids.</p>
