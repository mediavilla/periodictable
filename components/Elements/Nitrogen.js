            <h1>Nitrogen</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Nitrogen was discovered by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. He discovered it as a component of air that did not support combustion or living organisms, which he called 'noxious air' or 'phlogisticated air'.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Nitrogen' comes from the Greek words 'nitron' and 'genes', which mean 'native soda forming'. This is because it was first identified in nitric acid and nitrates.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, making up about 78% of it. It is also found in all living organisms as a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other important molecules. In the Earth's crust, nitrogen is found in nitrates and nitrites.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Nitrogen, the seventh element on the periodic table, is a nonmetal. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Nitrogen gas consists of two nitrogen atoms bonded together, forming a very stable molecule. This stability makes nitrogen relatively inert, meaning it doesn't react with many other substances at room temperature.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Nitrogen has many uses. It is used to make fertilizers, nitric acid, nylon, dyes, and explosives. It's used in the manufacturing of stainless steel, as a cooling medium, and in the storage of sperm, eggs, and other cells in cryopreservation. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze and transport food products, and even to remove warts and other skin lesions in dermatology.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>While nitrogen gas is quite unreactive due to the strong bond between its two atoms, under certain conditions it can react with other elements. It readily forms compounds with hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, among others, many of which are vital for life or have significant industrial applications.</p>
