            <h1>Beryllium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Beryllium was discovered by French chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin in 1798, while investigating beryl and emeralds. However, it wasn't isolated until 1828 by Friedrich WÃ¶hler in Germany and Antoine Bussy in France independently.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Beryllium' comes from the Greek word 'beryllos' which refers to the mineral beryl, the original source from which beryllium was first discovered.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Beryllium is found in around 30 mineral species, the most important of which are beryl and bertrandite. It's rather rare on Earth, and it is not found in a free state in nature due to its high reactivity with oxygen and water. Beryllium's largest producers today are the United States, China, and Kazakhstan.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Beryllium, the fourth element on the periodic table, is a relatively light metal that has a strong rigidity. It's also highly resistant to heat and electricity. It's one of the lightest metals, but still has a high melting point. This makes it valuable for many industrial applications. It's also notable that beryllium dust or powder can be dangerous if inhaled, so it needs to be handled with care.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Beryllium has many uses, largely due to its stiffness, light weight, and stability over a wide temperature range. It's used in aerospace materials, nuclear reactors, and even in some types of audio equipment. It's also used to make windows for X-ray machines because it's transparent to X-rays.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>While Beryllium doesn't like to react with other elements at room temperature, when heated or under pressure, it can form alloys with many metals. It forms strong and lightweight alloys with copper, for example, which are used in the aerospace industry. Also, its ability to slow down neutrons upon collision makes it a good moderator in nuclear reactions.</p>
