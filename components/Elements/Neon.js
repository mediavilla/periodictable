            <h1>Neon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Neon was discovered by British chemists Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1898. They discovered it through the study of liquefied air. The orange-red glow given off by electric discharge in the gas gave them a hint to its presence.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Neon' comes from the Greek word 'neos', which means 'new'. This is a fitting name because it was a newly discovered element at the time.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Neon is a rare gas that's found in the Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. However, it is the fifth most abundant element in the universe. Despite this, it's not easy to find on Earth because it does not react with other elements and escape into space over time.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Neon, the tenth element on the periodic table, is a noble gas. It's colorless, odorless, tasteless, and does not react with other elements. When electric current is passed through it, it emits a distinct reddish-orange glow. This is why it's commonly used in bright advertising signs known as 'neon signs'.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Neon is best known for its use in neon signs in advertising. It's also used in vacuum tubes, high-voltage indicators, lightning arresters, wave meter tubes, television tubes, and helium-neon lasers. Neon and helium are used as a mixture in gas lasers, which give an intense beam of light.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Being a noble gas, neon doesn't readily interact with other elements. It's one of the least reactive elements on the periodic table. It doesn't form compounds with other elements under normal conditions, which is why it's often used in areas where reactions are not desired.</p>
