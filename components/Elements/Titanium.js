            <h1>Titanium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Titanium was discovered in 1791 by English clergyman and geologist William Gregor. He found a black, magnetic sand that looked like gunpowder in a stream in the parish of Manaccan, England. The sand was actually an ore of titanium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Titanium' comes from the Titans of Greek mythology, known for their extreme strength. It was named by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth who rediscovered it in rutile ore.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Titanium is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. It's not found freely in nature but is found in minerals such as rutile and ilmenite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Titanium, the twenty-second element on the periodic table, is a strong, lustrous, corrosion-resistant transition metal with a silver color. It's as strong as steel but much less dense, making it very important in alloys.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Titanium is used in a wide variety of applications due to its strength, light weight, and resistance to corrosion. It's found in many alloys and is used in aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles. Its resistance to corrosion from seawater makes it useful for ship propellers, submarines, and other naval applications. Titanium is also used in surgical implants, such as hip balls and sockets, that can stay in the body for up to 20 years.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Titanium can react with oxygen at high temperatures, forming titanium dioxide. It also reacts with chlorine to form titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), which is used in smoke screens and as a catalyst. In general, titanium is known for its strong affinity to oxygen, which enhances its corrosion resistance.</p>
