            <h1>Silver</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Silver has been known since ancient times. It's one of the first five metals discovered by humans, the others being gold, copper, lead, and iron. We don't know who discovered it as it predates historical records.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The word 'Silver' comes from the Old English word 'seolfor'. The symbol for silver, Ag, comes from the Latin word 'argentum', which means 'shiny' or 'white'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Silver is found in the Earth's crust. It's often found in a pure form, as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals like argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Silver is a soft, white, lustrous transition metal. It's the best conductor of electrical and thermal energy of all the elements. It's also a powerful antimicrobial agent, and it's non-toxic to humans.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Silver is used in a wide range of applications. It's widely used in jewelry and silverware, in electrical contacts and conductors, in mirrors and coatings, in photography, and in medicine for its antimicrobial properties. Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Silver is known to form stable compounds with many other elements. It often bonds with sulfur in nature, forming the mineral argentite. Silver can also bond with oxygen, forming silver oxide, which is used in some batteries.</p>
