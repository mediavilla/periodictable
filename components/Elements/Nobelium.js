            <h1>Nobelium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Nobelium was first discovered by a team of scientists led by Albert Ghiorso at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1958. However, their results were disputed, and the official discovery was credited to a team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, in 1966.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Both teams had proposed the name Nobelium for the element in honor of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and benefactor who established the Nobel Prizes. Nobel held 355 different patents, many of them for explosives. Despite his role in creating destructive forces, Nobel's will established the Nobel Prizes, awarded annually for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Nobelium does not occur naturally. It's a synthetic element produced in a laboratory.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Nobelium is a radioactive metal and it is a member of the actinides series in the periodic table. It is predicted to be a solid under normal conditions and its chemical properties are not fully understood due to the difficulty in producing enough of it for studies.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its short half-life and scarcity, Nobelium has no known applications outside of scientific research.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Nobelium's most stable isotope, Nobelium-259, has a half-life of just over an hour, and the element is too unstable and rare to have its chemistry extensively explored.</p>
