            <h1>Zirconium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Zirconium was discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth when he analyzed the mineral zircon. It was later isolated in 1824 by Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jakob Berzelius.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Zirconium' comes from the Arabic word 'zargun,' which means 'gold-colored.' This is a reference to the color of the mineral zircon in which it was first found.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Zirconium is widely distributed in the Earth's crust, but it's not found in its pure, metallic form. It's often found in the mineral zircon, a major source of zirconium, and also in the mineral baddeleyite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Zirconium, the fortieth element on the periodic table, is a strong, malleable, and ductile metal. It's similar to steel in appearance. It's highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, and seawater, which makes it very useful in various industries.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Zirconium is primarily used in nuclear reactors due to its low absorption of neutrons. It's also used in the manufacturing of pipes, fittings, and heat exchangers. Additionally, its compound, zirconium dioxide, is used in ceramics, while zircon, a zirconium silicate, is used in abrasive applications and in jewelry as a diamond simulant.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Zirconium is quite reactive, it can form a variety of compounds when reacted with other elements. For instance, it reacts with oxygen to form zirconium dioxide, which is used in ceramics. It also forms a variety of alloys with elements like niobium, iron, and tin.</p>
