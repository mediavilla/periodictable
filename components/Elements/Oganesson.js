            <h1>Oganesson</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Oganesson (Og) was first synthesized in 2002 by a team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. It was produced by bombarding californium with calcium ions.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named in honor of Russian physicist Yuri Oganessian, who contributed significantly to the discovery of superheavy elements. The name Oganesson was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2016.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Oganesson does not occur naturally. It is a synthetic element, produced in a laboratory setting.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Oganesson is part of the group 18 elements in the periodic table, also known as noble gases. However, it is predicted to have properties that significantly differ from other noble gases, due to effects of relativistic mechanics. It is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and its most stable known isotope, Oganesson-294, has a half-life of about 0.89 milliseconds.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Oganesson has no known applications outside of basic scientific research, primarily due to its extreme instability and short half-life.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Due to its short half-life and extreme instability, there's limited information about Oganesson's interaction with other elements. However, unlike other noble gases, it is not expected to be unreactive. Instead, it's predicted to be a reactive element due to relativistic effects on its electron structure.</p>
