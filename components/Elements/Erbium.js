            <h1>Erbium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Erbium was discovered by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. He extracted it from the mineral gadolinite, which was named after the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin who first discovered the mineral.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Erbium was named after a town in Sweden called Ytterby. This village is famous because four elements were named after it: Ytterbium, Yttrium, Terbium and Erbium.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Erbium is not found freely in nature but is commonly found in minerals such as xenotime, euxenite, and monazite in the form of erbia, an oxide of erbium.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Erbium is a silvery-white metal which is malleable, soft, and fairly stable in air compared to other rare-earth elements. It belongs to the lanthanide series and has distinctive pink-colored compounds.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Erbium is used in a variety of ways. Its ions emit light in an ideal wavelength for optical fiber amplification, which makes it useful in communication networks. It's also used in nuclear technology as a neutron absorber. Additionally, erbium is used in medical lasers for dermatological procedures such as skin resurfacing.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Erbium can form various compounds by combining with other elements. For instance, when alloyed with vanadium, erbium lowers hardness and improves workability.</p>
