            <h1>Praseodymium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Praseodymium was discovered in 1885 by Austrian scientist Carl Auer von Welsbach. He separated praseodymium, along with the element neodymium, from a material called didymium by using repeated fractional crystallization.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Praseodymium' comes from the Greek words 'prasios' and 'didymos' which together mean 'green twin'. This is due to the green salts the element produces and the fact it was discovered alongside its 'twin', neodymium.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Praseodymium can be found in nature in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite, usually along with other rare earth metals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable, and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It's valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It will develop a green-tinged oxide layer when exposed to air.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Praseodymium is used to create high-strength metals for use in aircraft engines. It's also used in the glass industry to create yellow-colored glasses and ceramics, and to make certain types of goggles. Praseodymium alloys can be found in permanent magnets and flint lighters as well.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Praseodymium reacts slowly with oxygen to form Praseodymium(III) oxide. It also reacts with the halogens to form trihalides, and will burn at 150 Â°C to form the nitride PrN.</p>
