            <h1>Rubidium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Rubidium was discovered by German chemists Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff in 1861. They found it while analyzing the mineral lepidolite using a spectroscope. The deep red lines in the spectrum helped identify the presence of a new element, which they named Rubidium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Rubidium' originates from the Latin word 'rubidus,' which means 'deep red.' This refers to the bright red lines in its spectrum that led to its discovery.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Rubidium is quite abundant on Earth, although it's not found free in nature. It's usually found in minerals like lepidolite, pollucite, and carnallite. Rubidium is also present in seawater and in mineral springs.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Rubidium, the thirty-seventh element on the periodic table, is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group. It's highly reactive and pyrophoric, meaning it can ignite spontaneously in air. Rubidium has one of the lowest melting points among all metals and it's light enough to float on water.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Rubidium and its salts have several uses. Rubidium-87, a naturally occurring isotope, has been used in atomic clocks for its accuracy. Rubidium can also be used in vacuum tubes as a getter, a material that combines with and removes trace gases. In addition, it's used in some types of glass and in fireworks to give them a purple color.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Rubidium is very reactive, it reacts violently with water and can ignite spontaneously in air. In compounds, it often occurs as a salt, reacting with elements like chlorine, sulfur, and phosphorus. Rubidium can also form alloys with other metals.</p>
