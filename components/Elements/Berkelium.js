            <h1>Berkelium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>

            <p>Berkelium was first synthesized and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, and Stanley G. Thompson at the University of California, Berkeley. It was produced by bombarding americium-241 with alpha particles (helium ions) in a cyclotron.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>

            <p>Berkelium was named after the city of Berkeley, California, where it was discovered. The city of Berkeley is also home to the University of California, Berkeley, which has been instrumental in the discovery and study of many elements.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>

            <p>Berkelium does not occur naturally on Earth and is only produced in nuclear reactors or in the laboratory.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>

            <p>Berkelium is a radioactive metal that is a member of the actinide series. It is soft, silvery-white, and tarnishes in air at room temperatures. Berkelium-249, the most readily available isotope, emits low-energy electrons and thus is relatively safe to handle. It also emits alpha particles, which are a radiation hazard if ingested or inhaled.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>

            <p>Berkelium has no commercial applications and is used mainly for scientific research, especially in the production of heavier transuranium elements. Small amounts have been used in the production of the isotope berkelium-249, which decays into californium-249, a valuable source of neutrons.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>

            <p>Berkelium reacts with oxygen to form Berkelium(III) oxide (Bk2O3), and with halogens to form berkelium halides. It also forms various compounds with other elements in which it commonly exhibits a +3 oxidation state, though a +4 state has also been observed.</p>
