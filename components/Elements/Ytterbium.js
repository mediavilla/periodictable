            <h1>Ytterbium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Ytterbium was discovered by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1878. He discovered the element in a mineral known as gadolinite, which has been a source of several rare earth elements.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Ytterbium is named after the Swedish village Ytterby, a significant locale in the history of rare earth elements. Four elements in the periodic table are named after this village.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Like other rare earth elements, ytterbium is not found freely in nature. However, it's found in several minerals, including monazite and xenotime, which are sand-like deposits.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Ytterbium is a soft, malleable and ductile metal with a bright, silvery luster. It's fairly stable in air and reacts with water and dilute acids.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Ytterbium has a few uses. It can serve as a source of certain types of lasers, and it's used in the manufacture of stainless steel and other alloys. It's also used in certain types of radiation detection equipment.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Ytterbium reacts with a wide variety of other elements to form various compounds. It reacts slowly with cold water and quickly with hot, and it dissolves in acids.</p>
