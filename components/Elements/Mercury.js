            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Mercury has been known since ancient times, used by the ancient Chinese, Egyptians, and Hindus. The Greeks used mercury in ointments, and the Egyptians used it in cosmetics. It is not clear who discovered it, as it was known to the ancients.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Mercury's chemical symbol, Hg, comes from its Greek name, hydrargyrum, which means "liquid silver" â€” to reflect its shiny, metallic appearance. The element was named after the Roman messenger of the gods, Mercury, known for his speed and mobility.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. It exists in several forms: elemental (or metallic) mercury, inorganic mercury compounds, and organic mercury compounds. It is most often found in the Earth's crust as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide), but it is also found in other minerals.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white metal. As compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity. It has a unique property of being the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, with a melting point of -38.83 degrees Celsius and a boiling point of 356.73 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Mercury has many uses. It is used in thermometers, barometers, float valves, mercury switches, and other devices. It is also used in some electrical switches and relays, in certain vaccines, in dental amalgam for dental fillings, and to help recover gold from its ores. Mercury salts are sometimes used in skin lightening creams and as antiseptic creams and ointments.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Mercury does not react with most acids. It does, however, react with nitric acid and hot concentrated sulfuric acid. It combines with many metals like gold, silver, and zinc to form amalgams which are used to recover the metals from their ores.</p>
