            <h1>Tennessine</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Tennessine (Ts) was first synthesized in 2010 by a team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. It was produced via the bombardment of Berkelium with Calcium ions.</p>
            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element was named after the U.S. state of Tennessee, home to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Tennessee, which all contributed to the discovery. The name Tennessine was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2016.</p>
            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Tennessine does not occur naturally. It is a synthetic element, produced in a laboratory setting.</p>
            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Tennessine is part of the group 17 elements in the periodic table known as halogens. It is expected to be a heavy homologue of astatine, but its chemistry may significantly deviate from that of lighter halogens. Its most stable known isotope, Tennessine-293, has a half-life of about 22 milliseconds.</p>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Tennessine has no known applications outside of basic scientific research, primarily due to its extreme instability and short half-life.</p>
            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Due to its short half-life and extreme instability, there's limited information about Tennessine's interaction with other elements. It is expected to behave as a halogen, but no direct studies have confirmed this due to the difficulty in producing sufficient quantities of Tennessine.</p>
