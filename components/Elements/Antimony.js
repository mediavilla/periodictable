            <h1>Antimony</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Antimony was known in ancient times and was used by the Egyptians as early as 3000 BC in cosmetics. It was first recognized as a distinct element by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan in the 8th century.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Antimony' comes from the Latin words 'anti monos', meaning 'not alone', because it's rarely found in its pure form in nature. Its symbol, Sb, comes from the Latin word for the element, 'stibium'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Antimony is not usually found in its pure form, but in stibnite and other minerals. It's mainly obtained from the minerals stibnite and valentinite, and the largest producers of antimony are China, Russia, and Tajikistan.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Antimony is a shiny grey metalloid. It's brittle and has a flaky texture. It's a poor conductor of heat and electricity and is stable in dry air, but not in moist air where it may react with oxygen to form antimony trioxide.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Antimony's primary use is in the manufacture of flame-retardant materials. It's also used to harden lead for use in batteries, in ceramics and glass, and in a variety of chemicals and textiles. Additionally, it's used in semiconductor technology for making diodes, infrared detectors, and Hall-effect devices.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Antimony reacts with oxygen to form antimony trioxide, and it combines with other elements to form various compounds such as antimony sulphide. When combined with tin and lead, it forms alloys that are used in batteries and solders.</p>
