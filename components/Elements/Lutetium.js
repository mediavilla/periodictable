            <h1>Lutetium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Lutetium was independently discovered by three scientists, Carl Auer von Welsbach, Georges Urbain, and Charles James in 1907. However, credit usually goes to Urbain as he published his results first.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>Lutetium is named after the city of Paris, France. In Roman times, Paris was called Lutetia, and this is where Georges Urbain was working when he discovered the element.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Lutetium is found in very small amounts in nearly all minerals that contain yttrium. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Australia, and Sri Lanka.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Lutetium is a silvery white metal, and it is the hardest and the densest among all lanthanides. It is also considered one of the rarest and most expensive of the naturally occurring elements.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>While not abundant, lutetium has a few interesting uses. Its stable isotope, lutetium-176, is used to determine the age of meteorites. It's also used in petroleum cracking in refineries, and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Lutetium reacts slowly with water, but it will dissolve in dilute acid. It's known to form stable compounds with several other elements.</p>
