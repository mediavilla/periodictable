            <h1>Vanadium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Vanadium was discovered in 1801 by Spanish-Mexican mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río, who found it in a sample of Mexican "brown lead" ore, later named vanadinite.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Vanadium' comes from 'Vanadis', the old Norse name for the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility, Freyja, because of the beautiful multicolored compounds it forms.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Vanadium is not found free in nature but occurs in about 65 different minerals, including vanadinite, the ore he initially discovered. It's also found in phosphate rock, certain iron ores, some crude oils (in the form of organic complexes), and in meteorites.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Vanadium, the twenty-third element on the periodic table, is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, but once isolated artificially, it resists corrosion from oxygen, salt water, and various acids and alkalis.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>The majority of vanadium produced is used as a steel additive. Vanadium-steel alloys are used in armor plating, piston rods, and in the axles and crankshafts of cars. Another application of vanadium is in the making of a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid. Vanadium-gallium tape is used in superconducting magnets.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Vanadium has a strong ability to form compounds with other elements. When exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen to form a layer of vanadium oxide, which protects the metal from further oxidation. It also reacts with a variety of acids and bases.</p>
