            <h1>Actinium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Actinium was discovered by Friedrich Oskar Giesel in 1902. He discovered it independently of Friedrich Oskar Giesel, who discovered it in 1899. However, Giesel's name is often mentioned as the discoverer because he isolated it in a purer form and in greater amounts.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Actinium comes from the Greek word 'aktinos', meaning ray or beam. This is due to its strong radioactivity and the fact that it was discovered through its intense radiations.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Actinium is found in trace amounts in uranium ore, but it's more commonly made in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of 226-Ra in a nuclear reactor. Actinium metal has been prepared by the reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor at about 1100 to 1300Â°C.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Actinium is a silvery radioactive metal which glows in the dark due to its intense radioactivity. It is found in the earth's crust in concentrations of approximately 0.6 parts per trillion, making it one of the rarest elements. Actinium is the first of the actinide series and behaves similarly to lanthanides.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Actinium-225 is used in medicine to produce Bi-213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radio-immunotherapy. It's also used as a neutron source and in research.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with the other actinides and lanthanides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds.</p>
