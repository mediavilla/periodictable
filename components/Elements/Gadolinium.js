            <h1>Gadolinium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Gadolinium was discovered by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1880. He found its spectral lines in samples from a rare mineral called gadolinite.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>It's named after the mineral gadolinite, which was named in honor of Finnish chemist and geologist Johan Gadolin who had contributed significantly to the analysis of rare earth elements.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Gadolinium is found in several rare earth minerals including monazite and bastnaesite. It's not found freely in nature, but rather in combination with other elements.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Gadolinium is a silvery-white, malleable and ductile rare earth metal. It's known for its unique properties of high magnetocaloric effect and strong magnetism. It is also notably good at capturing neutrons.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Due to its neutron-absorbing abilities, Gadolinium is used in nuclear reactors. It's also used in making gadolinium yttrium garnets, which have microwave applications. In the medical field, gadolinium compounds are used as contrast agents in MRI scans.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Gadolinium can form compounds with various other elements such as Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon and more. Many of these compounds are used in electronic components and scientific research.</p>
