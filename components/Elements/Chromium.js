            <h1>Chromium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Chromium was discovered in 1797 by French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who was experimenting with a material known as Siberian red lead, also known as crocoite (PbCrO4).</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Chromium' comes from the Greek word 'chroma', which means color. It was named so because of the wide variety of colors found in chromium compounds.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Chromium is not found as a free element in nature; it's found as chromite ore. The largest producers of chromite ore are South Africa, Kazakhstan, India, and Turkey.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Chromium, the twenty-fourth element on the periodic table, is a lustrous, brittle, hard metal. It's silver-gray and is able to be highly polished. The most common oxidation states of chromium are +2, +3, and +6, with +3 being the most stable.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Chromium is primarily used in two ways: 1) as a plating on metal goods, such as car parts, bathroom fixtures, and kitchen appliances, to provide a corrosion-resistant, decorative, or hard coating, and 2) as a mordant, a substance used to set dyes on fabrics. Chromium compounds are also used in pigments and tanning.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Chromium is a very active element and can form many compounds. In the presence of oxygen, it forms a thin oxide layer on the surface that protects it from further oxidation or rust. It also reacts readily with acids to form a variety of chromium salts.</p>
