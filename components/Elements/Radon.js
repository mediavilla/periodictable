            <h1>Radon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Radon was discovered in 1900 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, a German physicist, when he observed that radium compounds emit a gas that was later identified as a new element, which he called radon.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Radon' is derived from 'Radium Emanation' as it was originally termed, being a decay product of radium. The name was officially changed to radon in 1923.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and comes from the natural breakdown (radioactive decay) of uranium. It is usually found in igneous rock and soil, but in some cases, well water may also serve as a significant source of radon.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Radon is a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas that is heavier than air. It is extremely radioactive and can accumulate in houses and other buildings. It's also chemically inert and maintains its noble gas state under standard conditions. Despite its radioactivity, it's considered a noble gas because it doesn't readily react with other elements.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Radon has been used in some types of therapeutic procedures, but these have been largely discontinued. It has found some utility in geological and atmospheric studies, as variations in its concentration can give information about the Earth's surface and weather patterns. However, the main concern associated with radon is in public health; it's recognized as a carcinogen and is linked to lung cancer.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Radon is a noble gas, so it tends not to chemically interact with other elements. However, it's radioactive and decays to form other elements, including polonium and lead, which can attach to dust and other particles in the air.</p>
