            <h1>Platinum</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Platinum was known to native South Americans before Columbus. European reference to platinum appears first in writings published by Julius Caesar Scaliger, an Italian physician, in 1557, describing it as an unknown noble metal found between Dari√©n and Mexico. Antonio de Ulloa is credited in European history with the official discovery of platinum in 1735.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name Platinum comes from the Spanish term "platina", which is literally translated into "little silver".</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Platinum is a rare metal occurring in the Earth's crust. It is usually found in its pure form or as a native alloy with other platinum-group metals. Most commercially produced platinum comes from South Africa, from the mineral cooperite (platinum sulfide). Some platinum is prepared as a by-product of copper and nickel refining.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Platinum is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious, gray-white transition metal. It is resistant to corrosion and tarnish. Platinum is considered a precious metal, although its use is not as common as the use of gold or silver. The frame of the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, manufactured for her coronation as Consort of King George VI, is made of platinum. It was the first British crown to be made of this particular metal.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Because of its high melting point and good catalytic properties, platinum is used in many ways, including in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts, but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Platinum does not oxidize in air at any temperature, but can be corroded by cyanides, halogens, sulfur, and caustic alkalis. It is insoluble in hydrochloric and nitric acid, but dissolves in hot aqua regia to form chloroplatinic acid.</p>
