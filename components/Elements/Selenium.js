            <h1>Selenium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Selenium was discovered in 1817 by Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius. Berzelius discovered the element while studying an impurity in sulfuric acid. The impurity made the acid react in unexpected ways, and it was eventually identified as a new element.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The element is named 'Selenium' after the Greek word 'Selene' which means 'moon.' Berzelius named it so because of its similarity to tellurium, whose name comes from 'Tellus,' the Latin name for Earth.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Selenium is not often found in its pure, elemental form. It's usually found in sulfide ores such as pyrite. It's also a byproduct of the production of copper. Moreover, selenium is found in certain types of volcanic rocks.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Selenium, the thirty-fourth element on the periodic table, is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below it. It exists in several forms, but the most stable form is a dense, gray, semi-metallic form that has a metallic luster. Selenium is photoconductive (its electrical resistance decreases with increased illumination), which is leveraged in many of its practical applications.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Selenium is used in a variety of applications from electronics to glassmaking. It's used in photocopiers, light meters, and solar cells due to its photoconductive properties. It's also used as a colorant in glasses, enamels, and plastics. In medicine, selenium is used as a radioprotective agent and in the treatment of dandruff.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Selenium can react with other elements to form various compounds. For example, when it reacts with oxygen, it forms selenium dioxide, a compound used as a colorant in glassmaking.</p>
