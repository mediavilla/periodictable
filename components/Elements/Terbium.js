            <h1>Terbium</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Terbium was discovered by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1843. He had previously discovered other rare earth elements, and identified terbium as a new element in a mineral that was thought to be yttrium.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name "Terbium" comes from the village of Ytterby in Sweden, which is also the namesake of yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium. This village was the site of a quarry that produced many rare minerals containing rare earth elements.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Terbium isn't found freely in nature, but in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, and euxenite.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Terbium is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with a silver-grey color. It's moderately reactive and can be found in two forms: with a stable cubic crystal structure, and a less stable body-centered cubic structure.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Terbium is used in color TVs and fluorescent lamps, as it can emit bright green light when exposed to electrons. Its alloys are used in magneto-optic recording technology, and terbium "green" phosphors are used in flat panel displays and fluorescent lamps.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Terbium can form compounds with various elements such as Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon and more. Terbium-doped fiber amplifiers have been developed for long distance fiber-optic communication systems.</p>
