            <h1>Lead</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Lead has been known since ancient times. It is not known who discovered it. The oldest known artifact of lead is a statuette found in the temple of Osiris on the site of Abydos, Egypt. This dates back to 3800 BC.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'lead' comes from the Anglo-Saxon word 'lead', which, in turn, originated from the Latin word 'plumbum'. The symbol for lead, Pb, also comes from its Latin name.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Lead is a relatively abundant element in the Earth's crust. It can be found in various ore deposits, primarily alongside zinc, silver and copper. Galena (PbS) is the most important lead ore.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Lead is a heavy, soft, malleable metal with a bluish-white color when freshly cut, but tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air. Its melting point is 327.5°C, boiling point is 1749°C, and its density is 11.34 g/cm³. Despite being highly corrosion-resistant, lead is toxic to humans and animals.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Lead has been widely used in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, radiation shielding, pigments, and crystal glass. Due to its toxicity, its usage has declined in many applications such as in paints and gasoline.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with Other Elements</h4>
            <p>Lead reacts with air to form a protective layer of lead oxide, lead carbonate, or lead sulfate, which shields the metal from further corrosion. It can form compounds with various other elements, and is known to form a vast number of inorganic and organometallic compounds.</p>
