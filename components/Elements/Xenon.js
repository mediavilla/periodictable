            <h1>Xenon</h1>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers in 1898. They found xenon in the residue left over from evaporating components of liquid air.</p>

            <h4>Name Origin</h4>
            <p>The name 'Xenon' comes from the Greek word 'xenos', which means 'stranger' or 'alien'.</p>

            <h4>Natural Occurrence</h4>
            <p>Xenon is present in the Earth's atmosphere to a small extent, about one part in 20 million. Most commercial xenon is extracted from the air in this way, as a by-product of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

            <h4>Properties and Characteristics</h4>
            <p>Xenon is a noble gas, meaning it's largely nonreactive due to having a full complement of electrons in its outer shell. It's colorless, dense, odorless and tasteless. When excited by electricity, it emits a beautiful blue or lavender light.</p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Xenon is used in certain types of lighting. This includes lamps used in movie projectors, car headlights, and even to make lasers. It is also used in medical imaging, anesthesia, and in the making of certain types of windows that are highly energy efficient.</p>

            <h4>Interaction with other Elements</h4>
            <p>Being a noble gas, xenon doesn't typically interact with many other elements because it's largely nonreactive. However, it can form compounds with highly electronegative elements such as fluorine and oxygen under certain conditions. These are used in the production of some types of lasers and in medical applications.</p>
